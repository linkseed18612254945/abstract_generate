Generate: this article describes a new approach to the translation of a translation from the translation of a translation of a source language, which a system utilizes a new paradigm for the translation of the translation is provided. by the translation and the translation of the translation of the input in the form process from a translation of the translation of a source language, which included a translation system is trained using a set of candidate translation from a translation from the translation and target language, we present an efficient translation and a translation system for the translation of the translation and the other is a significant improvement of the input and the translation is not significant, a translation system that are used to translate from the source language into a translation of a target language is a significant improvements in a translation task and the target language into the translation of the translation and the translation is not only

Topic: system and method for machine learning a confidence metric for machine translation
Generate: machine translation. this paper presents a method to improve mt system is a new method that are used for machine translation from the target language pairs of a sentence in the first work is a significant improvement in a target language. we propose a novel method to train the best of the source and the target language. we propose a new feature approach for the target language pairs and a set of a large scale corpus of candidate translation and a large corpus between the source language and the best translation score is obtained and the best of a large number of candidate translations for each language into a large number between a large number of words and the other system in a sentence in the first time with a stateoftheart machine translation system.

Topic: neural machine translation of rare words with subword units
Generate: we describe an opensource algorithm that are trained and an alternative model for a large vocabulary, which is an attentionbased nmt model for the translation quality between a translation quality between the target language pairs. we also with respect with a large vocabulary, between the target language pairs.

Topic: segmentation for english-to-arabic statistical machine translation
Generate: we propose an efficient model for machine translation. the quality of statistical mt system can be trained on a set of phrase translations in the nist 2003 chineseenglish test corpus is not only a small amount between the source and target language. our method can be used for a translation model.

Topic: the use of lexical semantics in interlingual machine translation
Generate: we describe an approach for machine translation. a method to generate the first machine translation. in the second is proposed to be presented.

Topic: error detection for statistical machine translation using linguistic features
Generate: we propose a new approach to use a statistical machine translation system to be used to produce a subset of a target language model to be translated with the target language into the target language. the model can improve the model to the source and target language into the target domain pairs by using a subset between a target domain with a subset between a source language model in the source and target domains. in this paper is a novel approach to a target domain adaptation model that can improve a new model for a target language. we also use a new model for a target language with the best input to be used for a phrase space from the source and target language into a target language. we use the model that are used for a source sentence in the test corpus we also show that our model achieves higher model to be used for both smt and 2) our experiments show that the best performance over the best performance on the training corpus.

Topic: maxsim: a maximum similarity metric for machine translation evaluation
Generate: in this paper, we present a new approach to a machine translation. experiments show the system can be evaluated for the nist 2003 translation quality of a translation score in a sentence but we show the effectiveness of our system that can achieve significant improvements over the proposed metric metric that are presented.

Topic: dialectal to standard arabic paraphrasing to improve arabic-english statistical machine translation
Generate: this article introduces a new approach for statistical machine translation. the first approach allows us for statistical mt system is a significant improvements in a phrasebased statistical translation task. we propose a novel statistical machine translation (smt) model that occur in a target language, we use a number between source and target side. in terms of the training set.

Topic: example-based machine translation using dp-matching between word sequences
Generate: we propose a new method to use the use of a source for a target machine translation by using the same input and the target language pairs of the target language pairs of the target language, we show that a new approach for a target language, a new model for each of the input and target language pairs for a translation of the input and a target language to the translation engine and the translation of a source sentence. the system can be used to be used to be used by using a stateoftheart mt system that it can be taken into account the best input than the input sentence can initiate translation quality.

Topic: handbook of natural language processing and machine translation: darpa global autonomous language exploitation
Generate: we present an efficient approach to the problem in recent years. we propose an automatic approach for the first time in the first work in the literature we present a new model to perform sentiment analysis for the target language. the first step, a new approach for each language into the source language into the target language is not fully not only not fully be trained in a source language.

Topic: applying morphology generation models to machine translation
Generate: we present a new approach for machine translation. we describe an approach to the problem in the task for machine translation system and the task is possible to the problem in statistical mt systems in a source language. we also show the system can be used to generate the translation quality of the source language and the translation quality of the translation quality on the nist mt05 and the best system and the best system is shown with significant improvements in the nist 2003 chineseenglish translation quality.
