sentiment classification using machine learning techniques	we consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform humanproduced baselines. however, the three machine learning methods we employed (naive bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topicbased categorization. we conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.	-11	363.5625
biographies, bollywood, boomboxes and blenders: domain adaptation for sentiment classification	automatic sentiment classification has been extensively studied and applied in recent years. however, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is impractical. we investigate domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on online reviews for different types of products. first, we extend to sentiment classification the recently proposed structural correspondence learning (scl) algorithm, reducing the relative error due to adaptation between domains by an average of 30% over the original scl algorithm and 46% over a supervised baseline. second, we identify a measure of domain similarity that correlates well with the potential for adaptation of a classifier from one domain to another. this measure could for instance be used to select a small set of domains to annotate whose trained classifiers would transfer well to many other domains.	-6	129.36363636363637
twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision	we introduce a novel approach for automatically classifying the sentiment of twitter messages. these messages are classified as either positive or negative with respect to a query term. this is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. there is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like twitter. we present the results of machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of twitter messages using distant supervision. our training data consists of twitter messages with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. this type of training data is abundantly available and can be obtained through automated means. we show that machine learning algorithms (naive bayes, maximum entropy, and svm) have accuracy above 80% when trained with emoticon data. this paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy. the main contribution of this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons for distant supervised learning.	-4	145.88888888888889
sentiment classification of movie reviews using contextual valence shifters	we present two methods for determining the sentiment expressed by a movie review. the semantic orientation of a review can be positive, negative, or neutral. we examine the effect of valence shifters on classifying the reviews. we examine three types of valence shifters negations, intensifiers, and diminishers. negations are used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular term, while intensifiers and diminishers are used to increase and decrease, respectively, the degree to which a term is positive or negative. the first method classifies reviews based on the number of positive and negative terms they contain. we use the general inquirer to identify positive and negative terms, as well as negation terms, intensifiers, and diminishers. we also use positive and negative terms from other sources, including a dictionary of synonym differences and a very large web corpus. to compute corpusbased semantic orientation values of terms, we use their association scores with a small group of positive and negative terms. we show that extending the termcounting method with contextual valence shifters improves the accuracy of the classification. the second method uses a machine learning algorithm, support vector machines. we start with unigram features and then add bigrams that consist of a valence shifter and another word. the accuracy of classification is very high, and the valence shifter bigrams slightly improve it. the features that contribute to the high accuracy are the words in the lists of positive and negative terms. previous work focused on either the termcounting method or the machine learning method. we show that combining the two methods achieves better results than either method alone.	-3	83.0
domain adaptation for large-scale sentiment classification: a deep learning approach	the exponential increase in the availability of online reviews and recommendations makes sentiment classification an interesting topic in academic and industrial research. reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. we propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. sentiment classifiers trained with this highlevel feature representation clearly outperform stateoftheart methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of amazon products. furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrialstrength dataset of 22 domains.	-2	84.85714285714286
target-dependent twitter sentiment classification	sentiment analysis on twitter data has attracted much attention recently. in this paper, we focus on targetdependent twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. the stateoftheart approaches for solving this problem always adopt the targetindependent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. moreover, the stateoftheart approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). however, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. in this paper, we propose to improve targetdependent twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating targetdependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. according to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of targetdependent sentiment classification.	-2	79.71428571428571
cross-domain sentiment classification via spectral feature alignment	sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of users publishing sentiment data (e.g., reviews, blogs). although traditional classification algorithms can be used to train sentiment classifiers from manually labeled text data, the labeling work can be timeconsuming and expensive. meanwhile, users often use some different words when they express sentiment in different domains. if we directly apply a classifier trained in one domain to other domains, the performance will be very low due to the differences between these domains. in this work, we develop a general solution to sentiment classification when we do not have any labels in a target domain but have some labeled data in a different domain, regarded as source domain. in this crossdomain sentiment classification setting, to bridge the gap between the domains, we propose a spectral feature alignment (sfa) algorithm to align domainspecific words from different domains into unified clusters, with the help of domainindependent words as a bridge. in this way, the clusters can be used to reduce the gap between domainspecific words of the two domains, which can be used to train sentiment classifiers in the target domain accurately. compared to previous approaches, sfa can discover a robust representation for crossdomain data by fully exploiting the relationship between the domainspecific and domainindependent words via simultaneously coclustering them in a common latent space. we perform extensive experiments on two real world datasets, and demonstrate that sfa significantly outperforms previous approaches to crossdomain sentiment classification.	-3	46.375
co-training for cross-lingual sentiment classification	the lack of chinese sentiment corpora limits the research progress on chinese sentiment classification. however, there are many freely available english sentiment corpora on the web. this paper focuses on the problem of crosslingual sentiment classification, which leverages an available english corpus for chi nese sentiment classification by using the eng lish corpus as training data. machine transla tion services are used for eliminating the lan guage gap between the training set and test set, and english features and chinese features are considered as two independent views of the classification problem. we propose a co training approach to making use of unlabeled chinese data. experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can outperform the standard inductive classifi ers and the transductive classifiers.	-4	42.666666666666664
dependency tree-based sentiment classification using crfs with hidden variables	in this paper, we present a dependency treebased method for sentiment classification of japanese and english subjective sentences using conditional random fields with hidden variables. subjective sentences often contain words which reverse the sentiment polarities of other words. therefore, interactions between words need to be considered in sentiment classification, which is difficult to be handled with simple bagofwords approaches, and the syntactic dependency structures of subjective sentences are exploited in our method. in the method, the sentiment polarity of each dependency subtree in a sentence, which is not observable in training data, is represented by a hidden variable. the polarity of the whole sentence is calculated in consideration of interactions between the hidden variables. sumproduct belief propagation is used for inference. experimental results of sentiment classification for japanese and english subjective sentences showed that the method performs better than other methods based on bagoffeatures.	-3	31.875

sentiment classification of online reviews to travel destinations by supervised machine learning approaches	the rapid growth in internet applications in tourism has lead to an enormous amount of personal reviews for travelrelated information on the web. these reviews can appear in different forms like bbs, blogs, wiki or forum websites. more importantly, the information in these reviews is valuable to both travelers and practitioners for various understanding and planning processes. an intrinsic problem of the overwhelming information on the internet, however, is information overloading as users are simply unable to read all the available information. query functions in search engines like yahoo and google can help users find some of the reviews that they needed about specific destinations. the returned pages from these search engines are still beyond the visual capacity of humans. in this research, sentiment classification techniques were incorporated into the domain of mining reviews from travel blogs. specifically, we compared three supervised machine learning algorithms of na茂ve bayes, svm and the character based ngram model for sentiment classification of the reviews on travel blogs for seven popular travel destinations in the us and europe. empirical findings indicated that the svm and ngram approaches outperformed the na茂ve bayes approach, and that when training datasets had a large number of reviews, all three approaches reached accuracies of at least 80%.	-4	36.77777777777778
sentiment classification on customer feedback data: noisy data, large feature vectors, and the role of linguistic analysis	we demonstrate that it is possible to perform automatic sentiment classification in the very noisy domain of customer feedback data. we show that by using large feature vectors in combination with feature reduction, we can train linear support vector machines that achieve high classification accuracy on data that present classification challenges even for a human annotator. we also show that, surprisingly, the addition of deep linguistic analysis features to a set of surface level word ngram features contributes consistently to classification accuracy in this domain.	-8	35.76923076923077
using emoticons to reduce dependency in machine learning techniques for sentiment classification	sentiment classification seeks to identify a piece of text according to its author070705s general feeling toward their subject, be it positive or negative. traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem with reasonable success, but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the training and test data with respect to topic. this paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important, and presents preliminary experiments with training data labeled with emoticons, which has the potential of being independent of domain, topic and time.	-4	51.55555555555556
sentiment classification of reviews using sentiwordnet	sentiment classification concerns the use of automatic methods for predicting the orientation of subjective content on text documents, with applications on a number of areas including recommender and advertising systems, customer intelligence and information retrieval. sentiwordnet is an opinion lexicon derived from the wordnet database where each term is associated with numerical scores indicating positive and negative sentiment information. this research presents the results of applying the sentiwordnet lexical resource to the problem of automatic sentiment classification of film reviews. our approach comprises counting positive and negative term scores to determine sentiment orientation, and an improvement is presented by building a data set of relevant features using sentiwordnet as source, and applied to a machine learning classifier. we find that results obtained with sentiwordnet are in line with similar approaches using manual lexicons seen in the literature. in addition, our feature set approach yielded improvements over the baseline term counting method. the results indicate sentiwordnet could be used as an important resource for sentiment classification tasks. additional considerations are made on possible further improvements to the method and its use in conjunction with other techniques.	-4	22.555555555555557
document-level sentiment classification: an empirical comparison between svm and ann	documentlevel sentiment classification aims to automate the task of classifying a textual review, which is given on a single topic, as expressing a positive or negative sentiment. in general, supervised methods consist of two stages (i) extraction/selection of informative features and (ii) classification of reviews by using learning models like support vector machines (svm) and na谋篓ve bayes (nb). svm have been extensively and successfully used as a sentiment learning approach while artificial neural networks (ann) have rarely been considered in comparative studies in the sentiment analysis literature. this paper presents an empirical comparison between svm and ann regarding documentlevel sentiment analysis. we discuss requirements, resulting models and contexts in which both approaches achieve better levels of classification accuracy. we adopt a standard evaluation context with popular supervised methods for feature selection and weighting in a traditional bagofwords model. except for some unbalanced data contexts, our experiments indicated that ann produce superior or at least comparable results to svm鈥檚. specially on the benchmark dataset of movies reviews, ann outperformed svm by a statistically significant difference, even on the context of unbalanced data. our results have also confirmed some potential limitations of both models, which have been rarely discussed in the sentiment classification literature, like the computational cost of svm at the running time and ann at the training time.	0	35.6
ensemble of feature sets and classification algorithms for sentiment classification	in this paper, we make a comparative study of the effectiveness of ensemble technique for sentiment classification. the ensemble framework is applied to sentiment classification tasks, with the aim of efficiently integrating different feature sets and classification algorithms to synthesize a more accurate classification procedure. first, two types of feature sets are designed for sentiment classification, namely the partofspeech based feature sets and the wordrelation based feature sets. second, three wellknown text classification algorithms, namely na谋篓ve bayes, maximum entropy and support vector machines, are employed as baseclassifiers for each of the feature sets. third, three types of ensemble methods, namely the fixed combination, weighted combination and metaclassifier combination, are evaluated for three ensemble strategies. a wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on five widelyused datasets in sentiment classification. finally, some indepth discussion is presented and conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of ensemble technique for sentiment classification.	-2	31.428571428571427
feature ensemble plus sample selection: domain adaptation for sentiment classification	domain adaptation problems often arise often in the field of sentiment classification. here, the feature ensemble plus sample selection (ssfe) approach is proposed, which takes labeling and instance adaptation into account. a feature ensemble (fe) model is first proposed to learn a new labeling function in a feature reweighting manner. furthermore, a pcabased sample selection (pcass) method is proposed as an aid to fe. experimental results show that the proposed ssfe approach could gain significant improvements, compared to fe or pcass, because of its comprehensive consideration of both labeling adaptation and instance adaptation.	0	29.4
topic sentiment analysis in twitter: a graph-based hashtag sentiment classification approach	twitter is one of the biggest platforms where massive instant messages (i.e. tweets) are published every day. users tend to express their real feelings freely in twitter, which makes it an ideal source for capturing the opinions towards various interesting topics, such as brands, products or celebrities, etc. naturally, people may anticipate an approach to receiving the common sentiment tendency towards these topics directly rather than through reading the huge amount of tweets about them. on the other side, hashtags, starting with a symbol # ahead of keywords or phrases, are widely used in tweets as coarsegrained topics. in this paper, instead of presenting the sentiment polarity of each tweet relevant to the topic, we focus our study on hashtaglevel sentiment classification. this task aims to automatically generate the overall sentiment polarity for a given hashtag in a certain time period, which markedly differs from the conventional sentencelevel and documentlevel sentiment analysis. our investigation illustrates that three types of information is useful to address the task, including (1) sentiment polarity of tweets containing the hashtag; (2) hashtags cooccurrence relationship and (3) the literal meaning of hashtags. consequently, in order to incorporate the first two types of information into a classification framework where hashtags can be classified collectively, we propose a novel graph model and investigate three approximate collective classification algorithms for inference. going one step further, we show that the performance can be remarkably improved using an enhanced boosting classification setting in which we employ the literal meaning of hashtags as semisupervised information.	-2	30.857142857142858
a non-negative matrix tri-factorization approach to sentiment classification with lexical prior knowledge	sentiment classication refers to the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a subject at hand. the proliferation of usergenerated web content such as blogs, discussion forums and online review sites has made it possi ble to perform largescale mining of pub lic opinion. sentiment modeling is thus becoming a critical component of market intelligence and social media technologies that aim to tap into the collective wis dom of crowds. in this paper, we consider the problem of learning highquality senti ment models with minimal manual super vision. we propose a novel approach to learn from lexical prior knowledge in the form of domainindependent sentiment laden terms, in conjunction with domain dependent unlabeled data and a few la beled documents. our model is based on a constrained nonnegative trifactorization of the termdocument matrix which can be implemented using simple update rules. extensive experimental studies demon strate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of realworld sentiment predic tion tasks.	-4	18.666666666666668
cross-domain sentiment classification using a sentiment sensitive thesaurus	automatic classification of sentiment is important for numerous applications such as opinion mining, opinion summarization, contextual advertising, and market analysis. typically, sentiment classification has been modeled as the problem of training a binary classifier using reviews annotated for positive or negative sentiment. however, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is costly. applying a sentiment classifier trained using labeled data for a particular domain to classify sentiment of user reviews on a different domain often results in poor performance because words that occur in the train (source) domain might not appear in the test (target) domain. we propose a method to overcome this problem in crossdomain sentiment classification. first, we create a sentiment sensitive distributional thesaurus using labeled data for the source domains and unlabeled data for both source and target domains. sentiment sensitivity is achieved in the thesaurus by incorporating document level sentiment labels in the context vectors used as the basis for measuring the distributional similarity between words. next, we use the created thesaurus to expand feature vectors during train and test times in a binary classifier. the proposed method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are comparable with previously proposed crossdomain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark data set containing amazon user reviews for different types of products.	0	24.8

automatic seed word selection for unsupervised sentiment classification of chinese text	we describe and evaluate a new method of automatic seed word selection for unsupervised sentiment classification of product reviews in chinese. the whole method is unsupervised and does not require any annotated training data; it only requires information about commonly occurring negations and adverbials. unsupervised techniques are promising for this task since they avoid problems of domaindependency typically associated with supervised methods. the results obtained are close to those of supervised classifiers and sometimes better, up to an f1 of 92%.	-5	14.6
employing personal/impersonal views in supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification	in this paper, we adopt two views, personal and impersonal views, and systematically employ them in both supervised and semisupervised sentiment classification. here, personal views consist of those sentences which directly express speaker's feeling and preference towards a target object while impersonal views focus on statements towards a target object for evaluation. to obtain them, an unsupervised mining approach is proposed. on this basis, an ensemble method and a cotraining algorithm are explored to employ the two views in supervised and semisupervised sentiment classification respectively. experimental results across eight domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.	-3	16.5
adapting a polarity lexicon using integer linear programming for domain-specific sentiment classification	polarity lexicons have been a valuable re source for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. there are a number of such lexi cal resources available, but it is often sub optimal to use them as is, because general purpose lexical resources do not reflect domainspecific lexical usage. in this pa per, we propose a novel method based on integer linear programming that can adapt an existing lexicon into a new one to re flect the characteristics of the data more directly. in particular, our method collec tivelyconsidersthe relationsamong words and opinionexpressionsto derive the most likely polarity of each lexical item (posi tive, neutral, negative, or negator) for the given domain. experimental results show that our lexicon adaptation technique im proves theperformance offinegrained po larity classification.	-4	15.666666666666666
sentiment classification using phrase patterns	this paper presents a phrase patternbased method in classifying sentiment orientation of text. that is to analyze whether the text expresses a favorable or unfavorable sentiment for a specific subject. in our method, we construct some phrase patterns and calculate their sentiment orientation by unsupervised learning algorithm. when we classify a document, we first add special tags to some words in the text, then match the tags within a sentence with some phrase patterns to get the sentiment orientation of the sentence. at last, we add up the sentiment orientation of each sentence. we classify the text according to this summation. the method achieves an accuracy rate of 86% when used to evaluate sports reviews from some websites.	-9	9.142857142857142
sentiment classification and polarity shifting	polarity shifting marked by various linguistic structures has been a challenge to automatic sentiment classification. in this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to incorporate polarity shifting information into a documentlevel sentiment classification system. first, a feature selection method is adopted to automatically generate the training data for a binary classifier on polarity shifting detection of sentences. then, by using the obtained binary classifier, each document in the original polarity classification training data is split into two partitions, polarityshifted and polarityunshifted, which are used to train two base classifiers respectively for further classifier combination. the experimental results across four different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	-3	13.25
semi-supervised learning for imbalanced sentiment classification.	in the field of machine learning, semisupervised learning (ssl) occupies the middle ground, between supervised learning (in which all training examples are labeled) and unsupervised learning (in which no label data are given). interest in ssl has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. this first comprehensive overview of ssl presents stateoftheart algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. semisupervised learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field smoothness, cluster or lowdensity separation, manifold structure, and transduction. the core of the book is the presentation of ssl methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. after an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the lowdensity separation assumption, graphbased methods, and algorithms that perform twostep learning. the book then discusses ssl applications and offers guidelines for ssl practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. finally, the book looks at interesting directions for ssl research. the book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semisupervised learning and transduction.	-7	10.0
selecting attributes for sentiment classification using feature relation networks	a major concern when incorporating large sets of diverse ngram features for sentiment classification is the presence of noisy, irrelevant, and redundant attributes. these concerns can often make it difficult to harness the augmented discriminatory potential of extended feature sets. we propose a rulebased multivariate text feature selection method called feature relation network (frn) that considers semantic information and also leverages the syntactic relationships between ngram features. frn is intended to efficiently enable the inclusion of extended sets of heterogeneous ngram features for enhanced sentiment classification. experiments were conducted on three online review testbeds in comparison with methods used in prior sentiment classification research. frn outperformed the comparison univariate, multivariate, and hybrid feature selection methods; it was able to select attributes resulting in significantly better classification accuracy irrespective of the feature subset sizes. furthermore, by incorporating syntactic information about ngram relations, frn is able to select features in a more computationally efficient manner than many multivariate and hybrid techniques.	-2	16.428571428571427
multi-level structured models for document-level sentiment classification	in this paper, we investigate structured models for documentlevel sentiment classification. when predicting the sentiment of a subjective document (e.g., as positive or negative), it is well known that not all sentences are equally discriminative or informative. but identifying the useful sentences automatically is itself a difficult learning problem. this paper proposes a joint twolevel approach for documentlevel sentiment classification that simultaneously extracts useful (i.e., subjective) sentences and predicts documentlevel sentiment based on the extracted sentences. unlike previous joint learning methods for the task, our approach (1) does not rely on gold standard sentencelevel subjectivity annotations (which may be expensive to obtain), and (2) optimizes directly for documentlevel performance. empirical evaluations on movie reviews and u.s. congressional floor debates show improved performance over previous approaches.	-3	15.0
adding redundant features for crfs-based sentence sentiment classification	in this paper, we present a novel method based on crfs in response to the two special characteristics of contextual dependency and label redundancy in sentence sentiment classification. we try to capture the contextual constraints on sentence sentiment using crfs. through introducing redundant labels into the original sentimental label set and organizing all labels into a hierarchy, our method can add redundant features into training for capturing the label redundancy. the experimental results prove that our method outperforms the traditional methods like nb, svm, maxent and standard chain crfs. in comparison with the cascaded model, our method can effectively alleviate the error propagation among different layers and obtain better performance in each layer.	-5	12.4
multi-domain adaptation for sentiment classification: using multiple classifier combining methods	sentiment classification is very domainspecific and good domain adaptation methods, when the training and testing data are drawn from different domains, are sorely needed. in this paper, we address a new approach to domain adaptation for sentiment classification in which classifiers are adapted for a specific domain with training data from multiple source domains. we call this new approach ‘multidomain adaptation’ and present a multiple classifier system (mcs) framework to describe and understand it. under this framework, we propose a new combining method, called multilabel consensus training (mct), to combine the base classifiers for selecting ‘automaticallylabeled’ samples from unlabeled data in the target domain. the experimental results for sentiment classification show that multidomain adaptation using this method improves adaptation performance.	-4	12.555555555555555
automatically extracting polarity-bearing topics for cross-domain sentiment classification.	joint sentimenttopic (jst) model was previously proposed to detect sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. the only supervision required by jst model learning is domainindependent polarity word priors. in this paper, we modify the jst model by incorporating word polarity priors through modifying the topicword dirichlet priors. we study the polaritybearing topics extracted by jst and show that by augmenting the original feature space with polaritybearing topics, the indomain supervised classifiers learned from augmented feature representation achieve the stateoftheart performance of 95% on the movie review data and an average of 90% on the multidomain sentiment dataset. furthermore, using feature augmentation and selection according to the information gain criteria for crossdomain sentiment classification, our proposed approach performs either better or comparably compared to previous approaches. nevertheless, our approach is much simpler and does not require difficult parameter tuning.	-2	13.285714285714286
mine the easy, classify the hard: a semi-supervised approach to automatic sentiment classification	supervised polarity classification systems are typically domainspecific. building these systems involves the expensive pro cess of annotating a large amount of data for each domain. a potential solution to this corpus annotation bottleneck is to build unsupervised polarity classification systems. however, unsupervised learning of polarity is difficult, owing in part to the prevalence of sentimentally ambiguous re views, where reviewers discuss both the positive and negative aspects of a prod uct. to address this problem, we pro pose a semisupervised approach to senti ment classification where we first mine the unambiguous reviews using spectral tech niques and then exploit them to classify the ambiguous reviews via a novel com bination of active learning, transductive learning, and ensemble learning.	-4	12.666666666666666
using multiple sources to construct a sentiment sensitive thesaurus for cross-domain sentiment classification	we describe a sentiment classication method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. we automatically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to nd the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. the created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classier. unlike previous crossdomain sentiment classication methods, our method can efciently learn from multiple source domains. our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous crossdomain sentiment classication methods on a benchmark dataset containing amazon user reviews for different types of products.	-2	13.857142857142858

mining sentiment classification from political web logs	over the last few years the number of web logs and amount of opinionated data on the world wide web has grown dramatically. web logs allow people to share their opinions on a wide range of hot topics with virtual communities. as readers start turning to web logs as a source of information, automatic techniques that identify the sentiment of web log posts will help bloggers categorize and filter this exploding information source. however, on the surface, sentiment classification of web log posts, in particular political web log posts, appears to be a more difficult problem than classification of traditional text because of the interplay among the images, hyperlinks, the style of writing and language used within web logs. in this paper we investigate existing technology and their utility for sentiment classification on web log posts. we show that a na茂ve bayes classifier can on average correctly predict a posting's political category 78.06% of the time with a standard deviation of 2.39. it significantly outperforms support vector machines at the 99.9% confidence level with a confidence interval of [1.425, 3.488]. on average, svms correctly predicted the category of web log posts 75.47% of the time with a standard deviation of 2.64. previous research was able to achieve an 81.0% accuracy using na茂ve bayes and 82.9% using svms using our chosen feature set representation on a nonspecific topic corpus [14]. using our dataset of political web logs over a twoyear period, we also show that it is important to maintain a uniform distribution in such datasets to avoid biases in classification.	-7	7.166666666666667

selc:a self-supervised model for sentiment classification	this paper presents the selc model (selfsupervised, (lexiconbased and (corpusbased model) for sentiment classification. the selc model includes two phases. the first phase is a lexiconbased iterative process. in this phase, some reviews are initially classified based on a sentiment dictionary. then more reviews are classified through an iterative process with a negative/positive ratio control. in the second phase, a supervised classifier is learned by taking some reviews classified in the first phase as training data. then the supervised classifier applies on other reviews to revise the results produced in the first phase. experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed model. selc totally achieves 6.63% f1score improvement over the best result in previous studies on the same data (from 82.72% to 89.35%). the first phase of the selc model independently achieves 5.90% improvement (from 82.72% to 88.62%). moreover, the standard deviation of f1scores is reduced, which shows that the selc model could be more suitable for domainindependent sentiment classification.	-4	8.666666666666666

a neural network based approach for sentiment classification in the blogosphere	recognizing emotion is extremely important for a textbased communication tool such as a blog. on commercial blogs, the evaluation comments by bloggers of a product can spread at an explosive rate in cyberspace, and negative comments could be very harmful to an enterprise. lately, researchers have been paying much attention to sentiment classification. the goal is to efficiently identify the emotions of their customers to allow companies to respond in the appropriate manner to what customers have to say. semantic orientation indexes and machine learning methods are usually employed to achieve this goal. semantic orientation indexes do not have good performance, but they return results quickly. machine learning techniques provide better classification accuracy, but require a lot of training time. in order to combine the advantages of these two methods, this study proposed a neuralnetwork based approach. it uses semantic orientation indexes as inputs for the neural networks to determine the sentiments of the bloggers quickly and effectively. several actual blogs are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional approaches including other neural networks and several semantic orientation indexes.research highlights? the proposed nn based method combines the bpn and so indexes to classify bloggers鈥 sentiment. ? nn based method can reduce training time when classifying textual data. ? nn based method outperforms traditional sentiment classification methods, bpn and so index, from experimental results.	-2	10.571428571428571

weakly supervised techniques for domain-independent sentiment classification	an important subtask of sentiment analysis is polarity classification, in which text is classified as being positive or negative. supervised machine learning techniques can perform this task very effectively. however, they require a large corpus of training data, and a number of studies have demonstrated that the good performance of supervised models is dependent on a good match between the training and testing data with respect to the domain, topic and timeperiod. weaklysupervised techniques use a large collection of unlabelled text to determine sentiment, and so their performance may be less dependent on the domain, topic and timeperiod represented by the testing data. this paper presents experiments that investigate the effectiveness of word similarity techniques when performing weaklysupervised sentiment classification. it also considers the extent to which the performance of each method is independent from the domain, topic and timeperiod of the testing data. the results indicate that the word similarity techniques are suitable for applications that require sentiment classification across several domains.	-4	7.666666666666667

cross-lingual mixture model for sentiment classification	the amount of labeled sentiment data in english is much larger than that in other languages. such a disproportion arouse interest in crosslingual sentiment classification, which aims to conduct sentiment classification in the target language (e.g. chinese) using labeled data in the source language (e.g. english). most existing work relies on machine translation engines to directly adapt labeled data from the source language to the target language. this approach suffers from the limited coverage of vocabulary in the machine translation results. in this paper, we propose a generative crosslingual mixture model (clmm) to leverage unlabeled bilingual parallel data. by fitting parameters to maximize the likelihood of the bilingual parallel data, the proposed model learns previously unseen sentiment words from the large bilingual parallel data and improves vocabulary coverage significantly. experiments on multiple data sets show that clmm is consistently effective in two settings (1) labeled data in the target language are unavailable; and (2) labeled data in the target language are also available.	0	7.2

active learning for imbalanced sentiment classification	active learning is a promising way for sentiment classification to reduce the annotation cost. in this paper, we focus on the imbalanced class distribution scenario for sentiment classification, wherein the number of positive samples is quite different from that of negative samples. this scenario posits new challenges to active learning. to address these challenges, we propose a novel active learning approach, named coselecting, by taking both the imbalanced class distribution issue and uncertainty into account. specifically, our coselecting approach employs two feature subspace classifiers to collectively select most informative minorityclass samples for manual annotation by leveraging a certainty measurement and an uncertainty measurement, and in the meanwhile, automatically label most informative majorityclass samples, to reduce humanannotation efforts. extensive experiments across four domains demonstrate great potential and effectiveness of our proposed coselecting approach to active learning for imbalanced sentiment classification.	-1	5.833333333333333
active learning for cross-lingual sentiment classification	crosslingual sentiment classification alms to predict the sentiment orientation of a text in a language (named as the target language) with the help of the resources from another language (named as the source language).how ever, current crosslingual performance is normally far away from satisfaction due to the huge difference in linguistic expression and social culture.in this pa per, we suggest to perform active learning for crosslingual sentiment classifica tion, where only a small scale of samples are actively selected and manually annotated to achieve reasonable performance in a short time for the target lan guage.the challenge therein is that there are normally much more labeled sam pies in the source language than those in the target language.this makes the small amount of labeled samples from the target language flooded in the ab oundance of labeled samples from the source language, which largely reduces their impact on crosslingual sentiment classification.to address this issue, we propose a data quality controlling approach in the source language to select highquality samples from the source language.specifically, we propose two kinds of data quality measurements, intraand extraquality measurements, from the certainty and similarity perspectives.empirical studies verify the appropriateness of our active learning approach to crosslingual sentiment classification.	0	6.6

sentirank: cross-domain graph ranking for sentiment classification	sentiment classification is attracting more and more attention because of its great benefits to social and human life. usually supervised classification approaches perform well in sentiment classification, but the performance decreases sharply when transferred from one domain to another domain. in this paper, we propose an approach, sentirank, which integrates the sentiment orientations of the documents into the graphranking algorithm for crossdomain sentiment classification. we apply the graphranking algorithm using the accurate labels of olddomain documents as well as the “pseudo” labels of newdomain documents, and investigate their relative importance for crossdomain sentiment classification. the experiment results indicate that the proposed algorithm could improve the performance of crossdomain sentiment classification dramatically.	-4	4.666666666666667
sentiment classification of customer reviews based on fuzzy logic	nowadays, ecommerce is growing fast, so product reviews have grown rapidly on the web. the large number of reviews makes it difficult for manufacturers or businesses to automatically classify them into different semantic orientations (positive, negative, and neutral). most existing method utilize a list of opinion words for sentiment classification. whereas, this paper propose a fuzzy logic model to perform semantic classifications of customers review into the following subclasses very weak, weak, moderate, very strong and strong by combinations adjective, adverb and verb to increase holistic the accuracy of lexicon approach. fuzzy logic, unlike statistical data mining techniques, not only allows using nonnumerical values also introduces the notion of linguistic variables. using linguistic terms and variables will result in a more human oriented querying process.	-3	4.75
opinion mining and sentiment classification: a survey	with the evolution of web technology, there is a huge amount of data present in the web for the internet users. these users not only use the available resources in the web, but also give their feedback, thus generating additional useful information. due to overwhelming amount of user’s opinions, views, feedback and suggestions available through the web resources, it’s very much essential to explore, analyze and organize their views for better decision making. opinion mining or sentiment analysis is a natural language processing and information extraction task that identifies the user’s views or opinions explained in the form of positive, negative or neutral comments and quotes underlying the text. text categorization generally classifies the documents by topic. this survey gives an overview of the efficient techniques, recent advancements and the future research directions in the field of sentiment analysis.	-1	5.5
sentiment classification using automatically extracted subgraph features	in this work, we propose a novel representation of text based on patterns derived from linguistic annotation graphs. we use a subgraph mining algorithm to automatically derive features as frequent subgraphs from the annotation graph. this process generates a very large number of features, many of which are highly correlated. we propose a genetic programming based approach to feature construction which creates a fixed number of strong classification predictors from these subgraphs. we evaluate the benefit gained from evolved structured features, when used in addition to the bagofwords features, for a sentiment classification task.	-3	4.25
research on language modeling based sentiment classification of text	presented in this paper is a language modeling approach to the sentiment classification of text.it provides the semantic information beyond topic in text summary when characterizing the semantic orientation of texts as thumb up or thumb down.the motivation is simplethumb up and thumb down language models are likely to be substantially differentthey prefer to different language habits.this divergence is exploited in the language models to effectively classify test documents.therefore,the method can be deployed in two stagesfirstly,the two sentiment language models are estimated from training data;secondly,tests are done through comparing the kullbackleibler divergence between the language model estimated from test document and those two trained sentiment models.the unigrams and bigrams of words are employed as the model parameters,and correspondingly maximum likelihood estimation and smoothing techniques are used to estimate these parameters.compared with two different classifiers,i.e.svms and na顣寁e bayes,on movie review corpus when training data is limited,the language modeling approach performs better than svms and na顣寁e bayes classifier,and on the other hand it shows its robustness in sentiment classification.future works may focus on finding a good way to estimate better language models,especially the higher order ngram models and more powerful smoothing methods.	-6	3.6363636363636362

use of negation phrases in automatic sentiment classification of product reviews	this paper reports a study in automatic sentiment classification, i.e., automatically classifying documents as expressing positive or negative sentiments. the study investigates the effectiveness of using a machinelearning algorithm, support vector machine (svm), on various text features to classify online product reviews into recommended (positive sentiment) and not recommended (negative sentiment). in the first part of this study, several approaches, unigrams (individual words), selected words (such as verb, adjective, and adverb), and words labeled with partofspeech tags were investigated. using svm, the unigram approach obtained an accuracy rate of around 76%. error analysis suggests various approaches for improving classification accuracy handling of negation phrases, inferencing from superficial words, and handling the problem of comments on parts of the product. the second part of the study investigated the use of negation phrase ngrams to improve classification accuracy. this approach increased the accuracy rate to 79.33%. compared with traditional subject classification which mainly uses unigrams, syntactic and semantic processing of text appear more important for sentiment classification. we expect that deeper linguistic processing will help increase accuracy for sentiment classification.	-8	3.5384615384615383
sentiment vector space model for lyric-based song sentiment classification	song sentiment analysis attracts much attention in research areas such as acoustic signal processing (asp) and natural language processing (nlp). the textbased efforts in the nlp community are found to be interesting. as a popular textbased solution, the lyricbased sentiment classification approach adopts the vector space model (vsm) to represent lyric text and assigns songs sentiment labels such as lighthearted and heavyhearted. four problems render the termbased vsm model ineffective. firstly, many words within song lyrics contribute little to expressing sentiment, but they are equally considered as term features. secondly, nouns and verbs being used to express sentiment are ambiguously used in natural language text. but the ambiguity is not addressed. thirdly, negations and modifiers accompanying the sentiment keywords make particular contributions to sentiment expressing, but the contributions are not reflected. lastly, song lyric is usually very short and data sparseness problem is serious. to ...	-5	3.8

a feature selection method based on fisher’s discriminant ratio for text sentiment classification	with the rapid growth of ecommerce, product reviews on the web have become an important information source for customers’ decision making when they intend to buy some product. as the reviews are often too many for customers to go through, how to automatically classify them into different sentiment orientation categories (i.e. positive/negative) has become a research problem. in this paper, based on fisher’s discriminant ratio, an effective feature selection method is proposed for product review text sentiment classification. in order to validate the validity of the proposed method, we compared it with other methods respectively based on information gain and mutual information while support vector machine is adopted as the classifier. in this paper, 6 subexperiments are conducted by combining different feature selection methods with 2 kinds of candidate feature sets. under 1006 review documents of cars, the experimental results indicate that the fisher’s discriminant ratio based on word frequency estimation has the best performance with f value 83.3% while the candidate features are the words which appear in both positive and negative texts.	-4	3.888888888888889
sentiment classification techniques for tracking literary reputation	the initial stages of a project tracking the literary reputation of authors are described. the critical reviews of six authors who either rose to fame or fell to obscurity between 1900 and 1950 will be examined and we hope to demonstrate the contribution of each text to the evolving reputations of the authors. we provide an initial report on the use of the semantic orientation of adjectives and their rough position in the text to calculate the overall orientation of the text and suggest ways in which this calculation can be improved. improvements include further development of adjective lists, expansion of these lists and the consequent algorithms for calculating orientation to include other parts of speech, and the use of rhetorical structure theory to differentiate units that make a direct contribution to the intended orientation from those that are contrastive or otherwise make an indirect contribution.	-7	3.0833333333333335
sentiment classification using rough set based hybrid feature selection	sentiment analysis means to extract opinion of users from review documents. sentiment classification using machine learning (ml) methods faces the problem of high dimensionality of feature vector. therefore, a feature selection method is required to eliminate the irrelevant and noisy features from the feature vector for efficient working of ml algorithms. rough set theory based feature selection method finds the optimal feature subset by eliminating the redundant features. in this paper, rough set theory (rst) based feature selection method is applied for sentiment classification. a hybrid feature selection method based on rst and information gain (ig) is proposed for sentiment classification. proposed methods are evaluated on four standard datasets viz. movie review, product (book, dvd and electronics) review dataset. experimental results show that hybrid feature selection method outperforms than other feature selection methods for sentiment classification. 1	0	4.8

sentiment classification through combining classifiers with multiple feature sets	sentiment classification aims at assigning a document to a predefined category according to the polarity of its subjective information (e.g. 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down'). in this paper, we present a classifier combination approach to this task. first, different classifiers are generated through training the review data with different features unigram and some pos features. then, classifier selection method is used to select a part of the classifiers for the nextstep combination. finally, these selected classifiers are combined using several combining rules. the experimental results show that all the combination approaches with different combining rules outperform individual classifiers and the sum rule achieves the best performance with an improvement of 2.56% over the best individual classifier.	-6	3.1818181818181817
document sentiment classification by exploring description model of topical terms	sentiment classification is used to identify whether the opinion expressed in a document is positive or negative. in this paper, we present an approach to do documentarylevel sentiment classification by modeling description of topical terms. the motivation of this work stems from the observation that the global document classification will benefit greatly by examining the way of a topical term to give opinion in its local sentence context. two sentencelevel sentiment description models, namely positive and negative topical term description models, are constructed for each topical term. when analyzing a document, the topical term description models generate divergence to support the classification of its sentiment at the sentencelevel which in turn can be used to decide the whole document classification collectively. the results of the experiments prove that our proposed method is effective. it is also shown that our results are comparable to the stateofart results on a publicly available movie review corpus and a chinese digital product review corpus. this is quite encouraging to us and motivates us to have further investigation on the development of a more effective topical term related description model in the future.	-2	4.428571428571429

adaptive co-training svm for sentiment classification on tweets	sentiment classification is an important problem in tweets mining. there lack labeled data and rating mechanism for generating them in twitter service. and topics in twitter are more diverse while sentiment classifiers always dedicate themselves to a specific domain or topic. thus it is a challenge to make sentiment classification adaptive to diverse topics without sufficient labeled data. therefore we formally propose an adaptive multiclass svm model which transfers an initial common sentiment classifier to a topicadaptive one. to tackle the tweet sparsity, nontext features are explored besides the conventional text features, which are intuitively split into two views. an iterative algorithm is proposed for solving this model by alternating among three steps optimization, unlabeled data selection and adaptive feature expansion steps. the algorithm alternatively minimizes the margins of two independent objectives on different views to learn coefficient matrices, which are collaboratively used for unlabeled tweets selection from the topic that the algorithm is adapting to. and then topicadaptive sentiment words are expended based on the above selection, in turn to help the first two steps find more confident and unlabeled tweets and boost the final performance. comparing with the wellknown supervised sentiment classifiers and semisupervised approaches, our algorithm achieves promising increases in accuracy averagely on the 6 topics from public tweet corpus.	0	4.4

a two-stage framework for cross-domain sentiment classification	supervised sentiment classification systems are typically domainspecific, and the performance decreases sharply when transferred from one domain to another domain. building these systems involves annotating a large amount of data for every domain, which needs much human labor. so, a reasonable way is to utilize labeled data in one existed (or called source) domain for sentiment classification in target domain. to address this problem, we propose a twostage framework for crossdomain sentiment classification. at the “building a bridge” stage, we build a bridge between the source domain and the target domain to get some most confidently labeled documents in the target domain; at the “following the structure” stage, we exploit the intrinsic structure, revealed by these most confidently labeled documents, to label the targetdomain data. the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach could improve the performance of crossdomain sentiment classification dramatically.highlights? propose a twostage framework for sentiment classification. ? build a bridge between the source and target domain. ? exploit the intrinsic structure. ? experimental results indicate the efficiency of proposed approach.	-2	3.7142857142857144
sentiment classification: a lexical similarity based approach for extracting subjectivity in documents	with the growth of social media, document sentiment classification has become an active area of research in this decade. it can be viewed as a special case of topical classification applied only to subjective portions of a document (sources of sentiment). hence, the key task in document sentiment classification is extracting subjectivity. existing approaches to extract subjectivity rely heavily on linguistic resources such as sentiment lexicons and complex supervised patterns based on partofspeech (pos) information. this makes the task of subjective feature extraction complex and resource dependent. in this work, we try to minimize the dependency on linguistic resources in sentiment classification. we propose a simple and statistical methodology called review summary (rsumm) and use it in combination with wellknown feature selection methods to extract subjectivity. our experimental results on a movie review dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.	-2	3.5714285714285716
cross-lingual sentiment classification via bi-view non-negative matrix tri-factorization	recently the sentiment classification problem interests the researchers over the world, but most sentiment corpora are in english, which limits the research progress on sentiment classification in other languages. crosslingual sentiment classification aims to use annotated sentiment corpora in one language (e.g. english) as training data, to predict the sentiment polarity of the data in another language (e.g. chinese). in this paper, we design a biview nonnegative matrix trifactorization (bnmtf) model for the crosslingual sentiment classification problem. we employ machine translation service so that both training and test data is able to have two representation, one in source language and the other in target language. our bnmtf model is derived from the nonnegative matrix trifactorization models in both languages in order to make more accurate prediction. our bnmtf model has three main advantages (1) combining the information from two views (2) incorporating the lexical knowledge and training document label knowledge (3) adding information from test documents. experimental results show the effectiveness of our bnmtf model, which can outperform other baseline approaches to crosslingual sentiment classification.	-2	3.5714285714285716

ensemble learning for sentiment classification	this paper presents an ensemble learning method for sentiment classification of reviews. the diversity among the machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification with different settings, which includes different features, different weight measures and the modeling of negation, is investigated in three domains, which gives a space for improving the performance. then the ensemble learning framework, stacking generalization is introduced based on different algorithms with different settings, and compared with the majority voting. according to the characteristic of reviews, the opinion summary of review is proposed in this paper, which is composed of the first two and last two sentences of review. results show that stacking has been proven to be consistently effective over all domains, working better than majority voting, and that using the opinion summary can improve the performance further.	-1	3.6666666666666665
sentiment classification of chinese traveler reviews by support vector machine algorithm	nowadays, online wordofmouth has turned to be a very important resource for electronic businesses. how to analyze user generated reviews and to classify them into different sentiment classes is gradually becoming a question that people pay close attention to. in this field, special challenges are associated with the mining of traveler reviews. at present, there is some research on sentiment analysis for english traveler generated reviews, but very few studies pay attention to sentiment analysis for traveler reviews in chinese. china is the largest country in terms of the number of internet users. internet technologies are gradually playing more and more important roles for many industries including tourism industry. the lack of sentiment analysis methods will block the use of wordofmouth for tourism industry in china. to solve the problem, this study conducts an exploring research on sentiment analysis to chinese traveler reviews by support vector machine (svm) algorithm. the experiment data of chinese reviews for hotels are downloaded from www.ctrip.com, the largest online travel agency in china. empirical results indicate that, comparing to prior studies on english reviews, svm algorithm can gain a very well performance of sentiment classification for traveler reviews in chinese.	-4	3.0
cross-lingual sentiment classification via bi-view non-negative matrix tri-factorization	summary recently the sentiment classification problem interests the researchers over the world, but most sentiment corpora are in english, which limits the research progress on sentiment classification in other languages. crosslingual sentiment classification aims to use annotated sentiment corpora in one language (e.g. english) as training data, to predict the sentiment polarity of the data in another language (e.g. chinese). in this paper, we design a biview nonnegative matrix trifactorization (bnmtf) model for the crosslingual sentiment classification problem. we employ machine translation service so that both training and test data is able to have two representation, one in source language and the other in target language. our bnmtf model is derived from the nonnegative matrix trifactorization models in both languages in order to make more accurate prediction. our bnmtf model has three main advantages (1) combining the information from two views (2) incorporating the lexical knowledge and training document label knowledge (3) adding information from test documents. experimental results show the effectiveness of our bnmtf model, which can outperform other baseline approaches to crosslingual sentiment classification.	-2	3.2857142857142856
is machine translation ripe for cross-lingual sentiment classification?	recent advances in machine translation (mt) have brought forth a new paradigm for building nlp applications in lowresource scenarios. to build a sentiment classifier for a language with no labeled resources, one can translate labeled data from another language, then train a classifier on the translated text. this can be viewed as a domain adaptation problem, where labeled translations and test data have some mismatch. various prior work have achieved positive results using this approach. in this opinion piece, we take a step back and make some general statements about crosslingual adaptation problems. first, we claim that domain mismatch is not caused by mt errors, and accuracy degradation will occur even in the case of perfect mt. second, we argue that the crosslingual adaptation problem is qualitatively different from other (monolingual) adaptation problems in nlp; thus new adaptation algorithms ought to be considered. this paper will describe a series of carefullydesigned experiments that led us to these conclusions. 1	-2	3.4285714285714284
combining collaborative filtering and sentiment classification for improved movie recommendations	summary recommender systems are traditionally of following three types contentbased, collaborative filtering and hybrid systems. contentbased methods are limited in their applicability to textual items only, whereas collaborative filtering due to its accuracy and its black box approach has been used widely for different kinds of item recommendations. hybrid method, the third approach, tries to combine content and collaborative approaches to improve the recommendation results. in this paper, we present an alternative approach to a hybrid recommender system that improves the results of collaborative filtering by incorporating a sentiment classifier in the recommendation process. we have explored this idea through our experimental work in movie review domain, with collaborative filtering doing first level filtering and the sentiment classifier performing the second level of filtering. the final recommendation list is a more accurate and focused set.	-2	3.4285714285714284
using objective words in sentiwordnet to improve sentiment classification for word of mouth	to improve the performance of sentiment classification for word of mouth (wom), this research reevaluates objective sentiment words in a sentiment lexicon, sentiwordnet. sentiwordnet provides each synonymous set with three sentiment values regarding positivity, negativity, and objectivity. as the evaluation of sentiments of words in wom is useful for sentiment classification, sentiwordnet has become a public and popular lexicon resource. this sentiment lexicon includes 117,659 entries but 93.75% of them have a stronger objective sentiment tendency than their sentimental counterparts. a sentiment lexicon such as sentiwordnet with so many objective words may suffer from noise in the application of sentiment classification. this research revises sentiment value and tendency for objective words in sentiwordnet based on assessment of the corelevance of each objective word and its associated sentiment sentences. experiments show that this proposed approach is significantly better than the traditional nonrevised approach as evaluated by the classification accuracy criterion.	0	4.0
appraisal expression recognition with syntactic path for sentence sentiment classification	an appraisal expression is described as a collocation of the polarity word and its modified target, which can be considered as an atomic unit expressing an evaluative stance towards a target. recognizing appraisal expressions is essential for sentence sentiment classification. however, the relevant research is far from enough. this paper proposes a novel method that uses syntactic paths to recognize appraisal expressions. compared with the previous work, the proposed syntactic path based method has two advantages 1) it automatically explores syntactic knowledge, and 2) it covers more syntactic relationships between polarity words and targets. based on these, this paper applies appraisal expressions to sentence sentiment classification. some novel features based on appraisal expressions, including semantic features, syntactic features, lexical features and polarity features, are designed to classify sentiment sentences as positive or negative. experimental results on the camera and mp3 player domains show...	-2	3.2857142857142856

augmenting chinese online video recommendations by using virtual ratings predicted by review sentiment classification	in this paper we aim to resolve the recommendation problem by using the virtual ratings in online environments when user rating information is not available. as a matter of fact, in most of current websites especially the chinese videosharing ones, the traditional pure rating based collaborative filtering recommender methods are not fully qualified due to the sparsity of rating data. motivated by our prior work on the investigation of user reviews that broadly appear in such sites, we hence propose a new recommender algorithm by fusing a selfsupervised emoticonintegrated sentiment classification approach, by which the missing useritem rating matrix can be substituted by the virtual ratings which are predicted by decomposing user reviews as given to the items. to test the algorithm's practical value, we have first identified the selfsupervised sentiment classification's higher performance by comparing it with a supervised approach. moreover, we conducted a statistic evaluation method to show the effectiveness of our recommender system on improving chinese online video recommendations' accuracy.	-3	2.75
verb oriented sentiment classification	sentiment analysis refers to a broad range of fields of natural language processing, computational linguistics and text mining. sentiment classification of reviews and comments has emerged as the most useful application in the area of sentiment analysis. although sentiment classification generally is carried out at the document level, accurate results require analysis at the sentence level. bag of words and feature based sentiment are the most popular approaches used by researchers to deal with sentiment classification of opinions about products such as movies, electronics, cars etc. until recently most classification techniques have considered adjectives, adverbs and nouns as features. this paper proposes a new approach based on verb as an important opinion term particularly in social domains. we extract opinion structures which consider verb as the core element. sentiment orientation is recognized from sentiments inside of opinion structures and their association with the social issue. experimental results show that considering verbs improves the performance of sentiment classification.	-1	3.0

super parsing:sentiment classification with review extraction	this paper describes the sentiment classification with review extraction. whole process can be illustrated logically as (1) extract the review expressions on specific subjects and attach sentiment tag and weight to each expression; (2) calculate the sentiment indicator of each tag by accumulating the weights of all the expression with the corresponding tag; (3) given the indicators on different tags, use a classifier to predict the sentiment label of the text. a system approximate text analysis (ata) is used for review extraction in stage 1. it follows the idea of super parsing, which enables nonadjacent constituents to be merged to deduce a new one. to traverse the valid constituent combinations in super parsing, an algorithm named candidate list algorithm (cla) is proposed. then the performance of three kinds of classifiers (a simple linear classifier, svm and decision tree) in stage 3 is studied. the experiments on online documents show that the svm algorithm achieves the best performance	-8	1.9230769230769231
a probabilistic approach to tweets' sentiment classification	prior to 2003, mankind generated a total of about 5 exabyte's of contents. now, we generate this amount of contents in about two days! the spread of generic (as twitter, facebook or google+) or specialized (as linked in or viadeo) social networks allows sharing opinions on different aspects of life every day. therefore this information is a rich source of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. this paper introduces a novel approach to the sentiment analysis based on the weighted word pairs obtained by the use of the latent dirichlet allocation (lda) approach. the proposed methodology aims at identifying a wordbased graphical model for depicting and mining a positive or negative attitude towards a topic. for the evaluation of the proposed approach a challenging scenario has been set the realtime analysis of tweets. the experimental evaluation shows how the proposed approach is effective and satisfactory.	0	3.2
text mining facebook status updates for sentiment classification	in recent years, text mining and sentiment analysis have received great attention due to the abundance of opinion data that exist in social networks such as facebook, twitter, etc. sentiments are projected on these media using texts for expressing feelings such as friendship, social support, anger, happiness, etc. existing sentiment analysis studies tend to identify user behaviors and state of minds but remain insufficient due to complexities in conveyed texts. in this research paper, we focus on the usage of text mining for sentiment classification. illustration is performed on tunisian users' statuses on facebook posts during the “arabic spring” era. our aim is to extract useful information, about users' sentiments and behaviors during this sensitive and significant period. for that purpose, we propose a method based on support vector machine (svm) and nai04ve bayes. we also construct a sentiment lexicon, based on the emoticons, interjections and acronyms', from extracted statuses updates. moreover, we perform some comparative experiments between two machine learning algorithms svm and nai04ve bayes through a training model for sentiment classification.	0	3.2

sentiment classification for indonesian message in social media	nowadays, classifying sentiment from social media has been a strategic thing since people can express their feeling about something in an easy way and short text. mining opinion from social media has become important because people are usually honest with their feeling on something. in our research, we tried to identify the problems of classifying sentiment from indonesian social media. we identified that people tend to express their opinion in text while the emoticon is rarely used and sometimes misleading. we also identified that the indonesian social media opinion can be classified not only to positive, negative, neutral and question but also to a special mix case between negative and question type. basically there are two levels of problem word level and sentence level. word level problems include the usage of punctuation mark, the number usage to replace letter, misspelled word and the usage of nonstandard abbreviation. in sentence level, the problem is related with the sentiment type such as mentioned before. in our research, we built a sentiment classification system which includes several steps such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. the text preprocessing aims to transform the informal text into formal text. the word formalization method in that we use is the deletion of punctuation mark, the tokenization, conversion of number to letter, the reduction of repetition letter, and using corpus with levensthein to formalize abbreviation. the sentence formalization method that we use is negation handling, sentiment relative, and affixes handling.	-1	2.5

sentiment classification of review documents using phrase patterns	sentiment analysis determines the polarity of text whether it belongs to positive or negative polarity. one motivation for sentiment analysis research is the need for user and ecommerce companies to know the public opinion from blogs, online forums, reviews about certain products, services, topics etc. phrases are important in extracting contextual information which is important for sentiment classification. phrases can convey sentiment information more efficiently than individual words. in this paper, sentimentrich phrases are extracted using partofspeech (pos) based rules and dependency relation in the document that are capable of extracting contextual and syntactic information from the document. next, semantic orientations of these phrases are calculated using pointwise mutual information (pmi) based method. finally, review document is classified after aggregating the semantic orientation of all the phrases into positive or negative polar document.	0	2.4
data mining for tweet sentiment classification	the goal of this master thesis is to classify short twitter messages with respect to their sentiment using data mining techniques. twitter messages, or tweets, are limited to 140 characters. this limitation makes it more difficult for people to express their sentiment and as a consequence, the classification of the sentiment will be more difficult as well. the sentiment can refer to two different types emotions and opinions. this research is solely focused on the sentiment of opinions. these opinions can be divided into three classes positive, neutral and negative. the tweets are then classified with an algorithm to one of those three classes.known supervised learning algorithms as support vector machines and naive bayes are used to create a prediction model. before the prediction model can be created, the data has to be preprocessed from text to a fixedlength feature vector. the features consist of sentimentwords and frequently occurring words that are predictive for the sentiment. the learned model is then applied to a test set to validate the model. the data that is considered in this research is based on two datasets, one from sananalytics and a selfbuilt twitter dataset.when the models are applied and tested insample the results were quite acceptable. however outofsample, with crossvalidation the results were disappointing. the sparsity in the dataset seems to cause the issue that the features in the training set does not cover the data in the test set well.	-1	2.1666666666666665
cross-domain sentiment classification using a two-stage method	in this paper, we give out a twostage approach for domain adaptation problem in sentiment classification. in the first stage, based on our observation that customers often use different words to comment on the similar topics in the different domains, we regard these common topics as the bridge to link the different domainspecific features. we propose a novel topic model named transferplsa to extract the topic knowledge between different domains. through these common topics, the features in the source domain are corresponded to the target features, so that those domainspecific knowledge can be transferred across different domains. in the second step, we use the classifier trained on the labeled examples in the source domain to pick up some informative examples in the target domain. then we retrain the classifier on these selected examples, so that the classifier is adapted for the target domain. experimental results on sentiment classification in four different domains indicate that our method outperforms other traditional methods.	-4	1.7777777777777777
a cross-domain adaptation method for sentiment classification using probabilistic latent analysis	sentiment classification is becoming attractive in recent years because of its potential commercial applications. it exploits supervised learning methods to learn the classifiers from the annotated training documents. the challenge in sentiment classification lies in that the sentiment domains are diverse, heterogeneous and fastgrowing. the classifiers trained on one domain (source domain) could not classify a document from another domain (target domain). the domain adaptation technique is to address the problem by making use of labeled samples in the source domain, and unlabeled samples in the target domain. this paper presents a new solution, a crossdomain topic indexing (cdti) method, with which a common semantic space is found from the prior betweendomain term correspondences and the term cooccurrences in the crossdomain documents. these observations are characterized with the mixture model in cdti, with each component being a possible topic shared by the source and target domains. such common topics are found to index the crossdomain content. we evaluate the algorithms on a multidomain sentiment classification task, which shows that cdti outperforms the stateoftheart domain adaptation method, i.e. spectral feature alignment (sfa), and the traditional latent semantic indexing method.	-2	2.0
a weakly supervised approach to chinese sentiment classification using partitioned self-training	with the rapid evolution of documents on the world wide web which express opinions, there exists an increasing demand for developing such a sentiment analysis technique that can easily adapt to new domains with minimum supervision. this article introduces a novel weakly supervised approach for chinese sentiment classification. the approach applies a variant of selftraining algorithm on two partitions split from test dataset, and combines classification results of the two partitions into a pseudolabelled training set and an unlabelled test set, then trains an initial classifier on the pseudolabelled training set and adopts a standard selflearning cycle to obtain the overall classification results. experiments on the four datasets from two domains show that our approach has competitive advantages over baseline approaches; it even outperforms the supervised approach in some of the datasets despite using no labelled documents.	0	2.4

adaptation and use of subjectivity lexicons for domain dependent sentiment classification	sentiment analysis refers to the automatic extraction of sentiments from a natural language text. we study the effect of subjectivitybased features on sentiment classification on two lexicons and also propose new subjectivitybased features for sentiment classification. the subjectivitybased features we experiment with are based on the average word polarity and the new features that we propose are based on the occurrence of subjective words in review texts. experimental results on hotel and movie reviews show an overall accuracy of about 84% and 71% in hotel and movie review domains respectively, improving the baseline using just the average word polarities by about 2% points.	-1	2.1666666666666665
instance selection and instance weighting for cross-domain sentiment classification via pu learning	due to the explosive growth of the internet online reviews, we can easily collect a large amount of labeled reviews from different domains. but only some of them are beneficial for training a desired targetdomain sentiment classifier. therefore, it is important for us to identify those samples that are the most relevant to the target domain and use them as training data. to address this problem, a novel approach, based on instance selection and instance weighting via pu learning, is proposed. pu learning is used at first to learn an intargetdomain selector, which assigns an intargetdomain probability to each sample in the training set. for instance selection, the samples with higher intargetdomain probability are used as training data; for instance weighting, the calibrated intargetdomain probabilities are used as sampling weights for training an instanceweighted naive bayes model, based on the principle of maximum weighted likelihood estimation. the experimental results prove the necessity and effectiveness of the approach, especially when the size of training data is large. it is also proved that the larger the kullbackleibler divergence between the training and test data is, the more effective the proposed approach will be.	0	2.4

dynamic construction of dictionaries for sentiment classification	the sentiment classification is one of the new challenges emerged with the advence of social networks. our purpose is to determine the sentimental orientation of a facebook comment (positive or negative) by using the linguistic approach. in most of the sentiment analysis applications using this approach, the sentiment lexicon plays a key role. thus, it is very important to create a lexicon covering several sentiment words. for this reason, we address in this paper the problem how to group and list words present in the corpus into two dictionaries. we proposed a new automatic technique to create the positive and negative dictionaries that exploits the emotions symbols (emoticons, acronyms and exclamation words) present in comments. more importantly, our idea allows to enlarge these dictionaries with an enrichment step. finally, by using these prepared dictionaries, we predict the positive and negative polarities of the comment. we evaluate our approach by comparison to human classification. our results are also effective and consistent.	0	2.2
feature subsumption for sentiment classification of dynamic data in social networks using scddf	the analysis of opinions till now is done mostly on static data rather than on the dynamic data. opinions may vary in time. earlier methods concentrated on opinions expressed in an individual site. but on a given concept opinions may vary from site to site. also the past works did not consider the opinions at aggregate level. this paper proposes a novel method for sentiment classification that uses dynamic data features (scddf). experiments were conducted on various product reviews collected from different sites using qtp. opinions were aggregated using bayesian networks and natural language processing techniques. bulk amount of dynamic data is considered rather than the static one. our method takes as input a collection of comments from the social networks and outputs ranks to the comments within each site and finally classifies all comments irrespective of the site it belongs to. thus the user is presented with overall evaluation of the product and its features.	-1	2.0

turning online product reviews to customer knowledge: a semantic-based sentiment classification approach	many product review websites have been established (e.g., epinion.com, rateitall.com) for collecting user reviews for a variety of products. in addition, it has also become a common practice for merchants or product manufacturers to setup online forums that allow their customers to provide reviews or express opinions on products they are interested or have purchased. to facilitate merchants, product manufacturers, and customers in exploiting online product reviews for their marketing, product design, or purchasing decision making, classification of the products reviews into positive and negative categories is essential. in this study, we propose a semanticbased sentiment classification (ssc) technique that constructs from a training set of precategorized product reviews a sentiment classification model on the basis of a collection of positive and negative cue features. furthermore, the proposed ssc technique includes a semantic expansion mechanism that uses wordnet for expanding the given set of positive and negative cue features. on the basis of three product review corpora, our empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed ssc technique achieves higher classification effectiveness than the traditional syntacticlevel sentiment classification technique does. moreover, the ssc technique with the use of few seed features (e.g., 10 or 20) can result in comparable classification effectiveness to that attained by the use of a comprehensive list of positive and negative cue features (a total of 4206 words) defined in the general inquirer.	-7	1.3333333333333333

sentiment classification with supervised sequence embedding	summary in this paper, we introduce a novel approach for modeling $n$grams in a latent space learned from supervised signals. the proposed procedure uses only unigram features to model short phrases (ngrams) in the latent space. the phrases are then combined to form documentlevel latent representation for a given text, where position of an $n$gram in the document is used to compute corresponding combining weight. the resulting twostage supervised embedding is then coupled with a classifier to form an endtoend system that we apply to the largescale sentiment classification task. the proposed model does not require feature selection to retain effective features during preprocessing, and its parameter space grows linearly with size of $n$gram. we present comparative evaluations of this method using two largescale datasets for sentiment classification in online reviews (amazon and tripadvisor). the proposed method outperforms standard baselines that rely on bagofwords representation populated with $n$gram features.	-1	1.8333333333333333

sentiment classification via integrating multiple feature presentations	in the bag of words framework, documents are often converted into vectors according to predefined features together with weighting mechanisms. since each feature presentation has its character, it is difficult to determine which one should be chosen for a specific domain, especially for the users who are not familiar with the domain. this paper explores the integration of various feature presentations to improve the classification accuracy. a general two phases framework is proposed. in the first phase, we train multiple base classifiers with various vector spaces and use these classifiers to predict the class of testing samples respectively. in the second phase, the previous predicted results are integrated into the ultimate class via stacking with svm. the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	-1	1.8333333333333333
sentiment classification for chinese reviews based on key substring features	one of the most widelystudied subproblems of opinion mining is sentiment classification, which classifies evaluative texts as positive or negative to help people automatically identify the viewpoints underlying the online usergenerated information. most of the existing methods for sentiment classification ignore word sequence and unlabeled test documents' structural information. this paper proposes a transductive learning based algorithm considering both of these two types of information. the proposed algorithm is implemented by firstly selecting key substrings in the suffix tree constructed from the strings in training and unlabeled test documents and then converting each original text document to a bag of numbers of the key substrings. finally, svm is employed to classify the converted documents. experiments on the open dataset (16,000 chinese reviews) demonstrate promising performance of the proposed algorithm, the accuracy being over 93.15%, which is much better than the performance of the existing sentiment classification methods, such as ngram features based classification algorithms. experimental results also show that 鈥渢fidfc鈥 performs much better than other term weighting approaches in sentiment classification for large text corpus. in particular, the reasons behind the proposed algorithm's outstanding performance are further studied and analyzed in this paper. moreover, the proposed algorithm can avoid the messy and rather artificial problem of defining word boundaries in chinese language.	-4	1.5555555555555556

weighted scl model for adaptation of sentiment classification	in recent years, structural correspondence learning (scl) is regarded as one of the most promising techniques for transfer learning. the main idea behind scl model is to identify correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features. however, scl model treats each feature as well as each instance by an equivalentweight strategy. from the perspective of feature, this strategy fails to overcome the adverse influence of highfrequency domainspecific (hfds) features they occupy a relative large portion of weight  in classification model, while hardly carry corresponding sentiment information. from the other perspective, the equivalentweight strategy of scl model does not take into account the labels (“positive” or “negative”) of labeled instance and the labels of pivot features positive pivot features tend to occur more frequently in positive instances and vice versa. to address the two issues effectively, we proposed a weighted scl model (wscl), which weights the features as well as the instances. more specifically, wscl assigns a smaller weight to hfds features and assigns a larger weight to instances with the same label as the involved pivot feature. the experimental results indicate that proposed wscl model could overcome the adverse influence of hfds features, and leverage knowledge from labels of instances and pivot features.	-2	1.5714285714285714

sentiment classification of chinese online reviews: analysing and improving supervised machine learning	with the boost of online reviews, a large quantity of consumers' opinions on certain products and services are generated and spread over the internet, thus techniques of sentiment classification for online reviews rise in response to the requirement of retrieving valuable information. this paper is mainly focused on improving sentiment classification of chinese online reviews through analysing and improving each step in supervised machine learning. at first, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs arc selected as the initial text features. then, three statistic methods (df, ig and chi) are utilised to extract features. at last, a boolean method is applied to set weight to features and a support vector machine (svm) is employed as the classifier. several comparative experiments have been conducted on reviews of two domains mobile phone (product) reviews and hotel (service) reviews. the experimental results indicate that part of speech (pos), the number of features, evaluation domain, feature extraction algorithm and kernel function of svm have great influences on sentiment classification, while the number of training corpora has a little impact. in addition, further improvements of df ig and chi have been made, which demonstrate the theoretical significance and the practical value of this research.	-1	1.6666666666666667
effectiveness of web search results for genre and sentiment classification	summary the motivation of this study is to enhance general topical search with a sentimentbased one where the search results (snippets) returned by the web search engine are clustered by sentiment categories. firstly we developed an automatic method to identify product review documents using the snippets (summary information that includes the url, title, and summary text), which is genre classification. then the identified snippets were automatically classified into positive (recommended) and negative (nonrecommended) documents, which is sentiment classification. thereafter the user may directly decide to access the positive or negative review documents. in this study we used only the snippets rather than their original fulltext documents, and applied a common machine learning technique, svm (support vector machine), and heuristic approaches to investigate how effectively the snippets can be used for genre and sentiment classification. the results show that the web search engine should improve the quality of the snippets especially for opinionated documents (i.e. review documents).	-4	1.3333333333333333
turning online product reviews to customer knowledge: a semantic-based sentiment classification approach	many product review websites have been established (e.g., epinion.com, rateitall.com) for collecting user reviews for a variety of products. in addition, it has also become a common practice for merchants or product manufacturers to setup online forums that allow their customers to provide reviews or express opinions on products they are interested or have purchased. to facilitate merchants, product manufacturers, and customers in exploiting online product reviews for their marketing, product design, or purchasing decision making, classification of the products reviews into positive and negative categories is essential. in this study, we propose a semanticbased sentiment classification (ssc) technique that constructs from a training set of precategorized product reviews a sentiment classification model on the basis of a collection of positive and negative cue features. furthermore, the proposed ssc technique includes a semantic expansion mechanism that uses wordnet for expanding the given set of positive and negative cue features. on the basis of three product review corpora, our empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed ssc technique achieves higher classification effectiveness than the traditional syntacticlevel sentiment classification technique does. moreover, the ssc technique with the use of few seed features (e.g., 10 or 20) can result in comparable classification effectiveness to that attained by the use of a comprehensive list of positive and negative cue features (a total of 4206 words) defined in the general inquirer.	-7	1.0833333333333333

bounce: sentiment classification in twitter using rich feature sets	the widespread use of twitter makes it very interesting to determine the opinions and the sentiments expressed by its users. the shortness of the length and the highly informal nature of tweets render it very difficult to automatically detect such information. this paper reports the results to a challenge, set forth by semeval2013 task 2, to determine the positive, neutral, or negative sentiments of tweets. two systems are explained system a for determining the sentiment of a phrase within a tweet and system b for determining the sentiment of a tweet. both approaches rely on rich feature sets, which are explained in detail.	0	1.6
sentiment classification analysis based on extraction of sentiment key sentence	a key problem of sentiment analysis is to determine the polarity of a review is positive(thumbs up) or negative(thumbs down).unlike topicbased text classification,where a high accuracy can be achieved,the sentiment classification is a hard and complicated task.one of the main challenges for documentlevel sentiment classification is that not every part of the document is equally informative for inferring the polarity of the whole document.thus,making a distinction between key sentences and trivial sentences will be helpful to improve the sentiment classification performance.we divide a document into key sentences and detailed sentences.key sentence is usually brief but discriminative while detailed sentences are diverse and ambiguous.for key sentence extraction,our approach takes three attributes into accountsentiment attribute,position attribute and special words attribute.to make use of the discrepancy and complementarity of key sentences and detailed sentences,we incorporate key sentences and detailed sentences in supervised and semisupervised learning.in supervised sentiment classification,a classifier combination approach is adopted because the original document is divided into two different and complementary parts;in semisupervised sentiment classification,a cotraining algorithm is proposed to incorporate unlabeled data for sentiment classification.experimental results across eight domains show that our approach performs better than the baseline method and the key sentence extraction is effective.	-1	1.5
sentiment classification of drug reviews using a rule-based linguistic approach	clauselevel sentiment classification algorithm is developed and applied to drug reviews on a discussion forum. the algorithm adopts a pure linguistic approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause using the sentiment analysis rules. metamap, a medical resource tool, is used to identify various disease terms in the review documents to utilize domain knowledge for sentiment classification. experiment results with 1,000 clauses show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and it performed significantly better than baseline machine learning approaches. various challenging issues were identified through error analysis, and we will continue improving our linguistic algorithm.	-1	1.5

integrating intra- and inter-document evidences for improving sentence sentiment classification	sentence sentiment classification is an important task of sentiment analysis. it aims to classify the sentences into positive, negative, or objective. one can consider sentence sentiment classification as a standard text categorization problem. however, determining the sentiment orientation of a review sentence requires more than the features inside the sentence itself, especially for the sentences with little or ambiguous inside sentence features. through observing, some features outside the sentence can interact with its inside features to enhance the overall performance of sentence sentiment classification. thus in this paper, we propose two such outside sentence features intradocument evidence and interdocument evidence. then in order to improve the sentence sentiment classification performance, a graphbased propagation approach is presented to incorporate these inside and outside sentence features. the experimental results on camera domain show that the proposed approach performs better than the approaches without using outside sentence features, and outperforms other representational previous approaches.	-3	1.375

snippet-based unsupervised approach for sentiment classification of chinese online reviews	sentiment classification seeks to identify general attitude of a piece of text of comments or reviews on certain subject, be it positive or negative. most existing researches on sentiment classification employ supervised learning approaches that rely on annotated data. however, sentiment is expressed differently on different subjects in different domains, and having annotated corpora for every domain of interest is not always practical. this paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach for classifying text of online reviews as recommended or not recommended. the proposed method is based on search engine snippet, summary information on the result page of a search engine. a basic assumption is that terms with similar orientation tend to cooccur. the cooccurrence is measured by utilizing snippets returned from search engines, with a query consisting of the text and a seed positive or negative word. with the information of snippets, the proposed method may estimate the association of candidate terms more accurately. this allows us to reliably predict the sentiment orientation of customer reviews. texts of customer reviews are then classified as recommended or not recommended if the average sentiment orientations of its phrases are positive or negative. the research data set of this study consists of 600 chinese online reviews about travel destinations retrieved from ctrip.com. our approach achieves an accuracy of 76.5%. factors that influence the accuracy of the sentiment classification of chinese online reviews were discussed.	-2	1.2857142857142858

a case-based approach to cross domain sentiment classification	this paper considers the task of sentiment classification of subjective text across many domains, in particular on scenarios where no indomain data is available. motivated by the more general applicability of such methods, we propose an extensible approach to sentiment classification that leverages sentiment lexicons and outofdomain data to build a casebased system where solutions to past cases are reused to predict the sentiment of new documents from an unknown domain. in our approach the case representation uses a set of features based on document statistics, while the case solution stores sentiment lexicons employed on past predictions allowing for later retrieval and reuse on similar documents. the casebased nature of our approach also allows for future improvements since new lexicons and classification methods can be added to the case base as they become available. on a cross domain experiment our method has shown robust results when compared to a baseline singlelexicon classifier where the lexicon has to be preselected for the domain in question.	-1	1.3333333333333333
recognizing contextual valence shifters in document-level sentiment classification	sentiment classification is an emerging research field. due to the rich opinionated web content, people and organizations are interested in knowing others' opinions, so they needan automated tool for analyzing and summarizing these opinions. one of the major tasks of sentiment classification is to classify a document (i.e. a blog, news article or review) as holding an overall positive or negative sentiment. machine learning approaches havesucceeded in achieving better results than semantic orientation approaches in documentlevel sentiment classification; however, they still need to take linguistic context into account,by making use of the socalled contextual valence shifters. early research has tried to add sentiment features and contextual valence shifters to the machine learning approach to tackle this problem, but the classifier's performance was low.in this study, we would like to improve the performance of documentlevel sentiment classification using the machine learning approach by proposing new feature sets that refine the traditional sentiment feature extraction method and take contextual valence shiftersinto consideration from a different perspective than the earlier research. these feature sets include 1) a feature set consisting of 16 features for counting different categories of contextual valence shifters (intensifiers, negators and polarity shifters) as well as the frequency of words grouped according to their final (modified) polarity; and 2) another feature set consisting of the frequency of each sentiment word after modifying its prior polarity.	-2	1.1428571428571428

revised mutual information approach for german text sentiment classification	the significant increase in content of online social media such as product reviews, blogs, forums etc., have led to an increasing attention to sentiment analysis tools and approaches that make use of mining this substantially growing content. the aim of this paper is to develop a robust classification approach of customer reviews based on a selfannotated domainspecific corpus by applying a statistical approach i.e., mutual information. first, subjective words in each test sentence are identified. second, ambiguous adjectives such as high, low, large, many etc., are disambiguated based on their accompanying noun using a conditional mutual information approach. third, a mutual information approach is applied to find the sentiment orientation (polarity) of the identified subjective words based on analyzing their statistical relationship with the manually annotated sentiment labels within a sizeable sentiment training data. fourth, since negation plays a significant role in flipping the sentiment polarity of an identified sentiment word, we estimate the role of negation in affecting the classification accuracy. finally, the identified polarity for each test sentence is evaluated against experts' annotation.	0	1.2
sentiment classification using machine learning techniques with syntax features	sentiment classification has adopted machine learning techniques to improve its precision and efficiency. however, the features are always produced by basic wordsbag methods without much consideration for words' syntactic properties, which could play an important role in the judgment of sentiment meanings. to remedy this, we firstly generate syntax trees of the sentences, with the analysis of syntactic features of the sentences. then we introduce multiple sentiment features into the basic wordsbag features. such features were trained on movie reviews as data, with machine learning methods (naive bayes and support vector machines). the features and factors introduced by syntax tree were examined to generate a more accurate solution for sentiment classification.	3	42.5
cross-domain sentiment classification using sentiment sensitive embeddings	unsupervised crossdomain sentiment classification is the task of adapting a sentiment classifier trained on a particular domain (source domain), to a different domain (target domain), without requiring any labeled data for the target domain. by adapting an existing sentiment classifier to previously unseen target domains, we can avoid the cost for manual data annotation for the target domain. we model this problem as embedding learning, and construct three objective functions that capture (a) distributional properties of  pivots (i.e., common features that appear in both source and target domains), (b) label constraints in the source domain documents, and (c) geometric properties in the unlabeled documents in both source and target domains. unlike prior proposals that first learn a lowerdimensional embedding independent of the source domain sentiment labels, and next a sentiment classifier in this embedding, our joint optimisation method learns embeddings that are sensitive to sentiment classification. experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that by jointly optimising the three objectives we can obtain better performances in comparison to optimising each objective function separately, thereby demonstrating the importance of taskspecific embedding learning for crossdomain sentiment classification. among the individual objective functions, the best performance is obtained by (c). moreover, the proposed method reports crossdomain sentiment classification accuracies that are statistically comparable to the current stateoftheart embedding learning methods for crossdomain sentiment classification.	3	33.5

learning sentiment-specific word embedding for twitter sentiment classification	we present a method that learns word embedding for twitter sentiment classification in this paper. most existing algorithms for learning continuous word representations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment of text. this is problematic for sentiment analysis as they usually map words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors. we address this issue by learning sentimentspecific word embedding (sswe), which encodes sentiment information in the continuous representation of words. specifically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their loss functions. to obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentimentspecific word embedding from massive distantsupervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons. experiments on applying sswe to a benchmark twitter sentiment classification dataset in semeval 2013 show that (1) the sswe feature performs comparably with handcrafted features in the topperformed system; (2) the performance is further improved by concatenating sswe with existing feature set.	1	58.0
document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for sentiment classification	emoji is an essential component in dialogues which has been broadly utilized on almost all social platforms. it could express more delicate feelings beyond plain texts and thus smooth the communications between users, making dialogue systems more anthropomorphic and vivid. in this paper, we focus on automatically recommending appropriate emojis given the contextual information in multiturn.	2	36.0

harnessing wordnet senses for supervised sentiment classification.	traditional approaches to sentiment classification rely on lexical features, syntaxbased features or a combination of the two. we propose semantic features using word senses for a supervised documentlevel sentiment classifier. to highlight the benefit of sensebased features, we compare wordbased representation of documents with a sensebased representation where wordnet senses of the words are used as features. in addition, we highlight the benefit of senses by presenting a partofspeechwise effect on sentiment classification. finally, we show that even if a wsd engine disambiguates between a limited set of words in a document, a sentiment classifier still performs better than what it does in absence of sense annotation. since word senses used as features show promise, we also examine the possibility of using similarity metrics defined on wordnet to address the problem of not finding a sense in the training corpus. we perform experiments using three popular similarity metrics to mitigate the effect of unknown synsets in a test corpus by replacing them with similar synsets from the training corpus. the results show promising improvement with respect to the baseline.	1	10.0
a multi-label classification based approach for sentiment classification	a detailed empirical study of different multilabel classification methods on sentiment classification is conducted to compare their classification performances. specifically, total 11 state of the art multilabel classification methods are compared on two microblog datasets and 8 evaluation metrics are used. the effects of the three sentiment dictionaries for multilabel classification are empirically studied and compared, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been performed. the performed empirical comparisons show that dalian university of technology sentiment dictionary has the best performance among the three different sentiment dictionaries.	2	9.0
swisscheese at semeval-2016 task 4: sentiment classification using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks with distant supervision	in this paper, we propose a classifier for predicting messagelevel sentiments of en glish microblog messages from twitter. our method builds upon the convolutional sen tence embedding approach proposed by (sev eryn and moschitti, 2015a; severyn and mos chitti, 2015b). we leverage large amounts of data with distant supervision to train an en semble of 2layer convolutional neural net works whose predictions are combined using a random forest classifier. our approach was evaluated on the datasets of the semeval2016 competition (task 4) outperforming all other approaches for the message polarity classifi cation task.	3	13.5
learning semantic representations of users and products for document level sentiment classification	review rating prediction is an important research topic. the problem was approached from either the perspective of recommender systems (rs) or that of sentiment analysis (sa). recent sa research using deep neural networks (dnns) has realized the importance of user and product interaction for better interpreting the sentiment of reviews.	2	14.333333333333334
lifelong learning for sentiment classification	this paper proposes a novel lifelong learning (ll) approach to sentiment classification. ll mimics the human continuous learning process, i.e., retaining the knowledge learned from past tasks and use it to help future learning. in this paper, we first discuss ll in general and then ll for sentiment classification in particular. the proposed ll approach adopts a bayesian optimization framework based on stochastic gradient descent. our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods significantly, which demonstrates that lifelong learning is a promising research direction.	2	5.0
aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network	we introduce a deep memory network for aspect level sentiment classification. unlike featurebased svm and sequential neural models such as lstm, this approach explicitly captures the importance of each context word when inferring the sentiment polarity of an aspect. such importance degree and text representation are calculated with multiple computational layers, each of which is a neural attention model over an external memory. experiments on laptop and restaurant datasets demonstrate that our approach performs comparable to stateofart feature based svm system, and substantially better than lstm and attentionbased lstm architectures. on both datasets we show that multiple computational layers could improve the performance. moreover, our approach is also fast. the deep memory network with 9 layers is 15 times faster than lstm with a cpu implementation.	3	7.0
tasc:topic-adaptive sentiment classification on dynamic tweets	sentiment classification is a topicsensitive task, i.e., a classifier trained from one topic will perform worse on another. this is especially a problem for the tweets sentiment analysis. since the topics in twitter are very diverse, it is impossible to train a universal classifier for all topics. moreover, compared to product review, twitter lacks data labeling and a rating mechanism to acquire sentiment labels. the extremely sparse text of tweets also brings down the performance of a sentiment classifier. in this paper, we propose a semisupervised topicadaptive sentiment classification (tasc) model, which starts with a classifier built on common features and mixed labeled data from various topics. it minimizes the hinge loss to adapt to unlabeled data and features including topicrelated sentiment words, authors' sentiments and sentiment connections derived from“@” mentions of tweets, named as topicadaptive features. text and nontext features are extracted and naturally split into two views for cotraining. the tasc learning algorithm updates topicadaptive features based on the collaborative selection of unlabeled data, which in turn helps to select more reliable tweets to boost the performance. we also design the adapting model along a timeline (tasct) for dynamic tweets. an experiment on 6 topics from published tweet corpuses demonstrates that tasc outperforms other wellknown supervised and ensemble classifiers. it also beats those semisupervised learning methods without feature adaption. meanwhile, tasct can also achieve impressive accuracy and fscore. finally, with timeline visualization of “river” graph, people can intuitively grasp the ups and downs of sentiments' evolvement, and the intensity by color gradation.	2	5.666666666666667
multilingual twitter sentiment classification: the role of human annotators	what are the limits of automated twitter sentiment classification? we analyze a large set of manually labeled tweets in different languages, use them as training data, and construct automated classification models. it turns out that the quality of classification models depends much more on the quality and size of training data than on the type of the model trained. experimental results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of the top classification models. we quantify the quality of training data by applying various annotator agreement measures, and identify the weakest points of different datasets. we show that the model performance approaches the interannotator agreement when the size of the training set is sufficiently large. however, it is crucial to regularly monitor the self and interannotator agreements since this improves the training datasets and consequently the model performance. finally, we show that there is strong evidence that humans perceive the sentiment classes (negative, neutral, and positive) as ordered.	3	7.5
context-sensitive twitter sentiment classification using neural network	sentiment classification on twitter has attracted increasing research in recent years.most existing work focuses on feature engineering according to the tweet content itself.in this paper, we propose a contextbased neural network model for twitter sentiment analysis, incorporating contextualized features from relevant tweets into the model in the form of word embedding vectors.experiments on both balanced and unbalanced datasets show that our proposed models outperform the current stateoftheart.	3	8.5
effective lstms for target-dependent sentiment classification	targetdependent sentiment classification remains a challenge modeling the semantic relatedness of a target with its context words in a sentence. different context words have different influences on determining the sentiment polarity of a sentence towards the target. therefore, it is desirable to integrate the connections between target word and context words when building a learning system. in this paper, we develop two target dependent long shortterm memory (lstm) models, where target information is automatically taken into account. we evaluate our methods on a benchmark dataset from twitter. empirical results show that modeling sentence representation with standard lstm does not perform well. incorporating target information into lstm can significantly boost the classification accuracy. the targetdependent lstm models achieve stateoftheart performances without using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons.	3	7.0
do users rate or review?: boost phrase-level sentiment labeling with review-level sentiment classification	current approaches for contextual sentiment lexicon construction in phraselevel sentiment analysis assume that the numerical star rating of a review represents the overall sentiment orientation of the review text. although widely adopted, we find through user rating analysis that this is not necessarily true. in this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between phraselevel and review/documentlevel sentiment analysis by leveraging the results given by reviewlevel sentiment classification to boost phraselevel sentiment polarity labeling in contextual sentiment lexicon construction tasks, using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. experimental results on both english and chinese reviews show that our framework improves the precision of sentiment polarity labeling by up to 5.6%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.	1	4.25

combination of active learning and self-training for cross-lingual sentiment classification with density analysis of unlabelled samples	in recent years, research in sentiment classification has received considerable attention by natural language processing researchers. annotated sentiment corpora are the most important resources used in sentiment classification. however, since most recent research works in this field have focused on the english language, there are accordingly not enough annotated sentiment resources in other languages. manual construction of reliable annotated sentiment corpora for a new language is a labourintensive and timeconsuming task. projection of sentiment corpus from one language into another language is a natural solution used in crosslingual sentiment classification. automatic machine translation services are the most commonly tools used to directly project information from one language into another. however, since term distribution across languages may be different due to variations in linguistic terms and writing styles, crosslingual methods cannot reach the performance of monolingual methods. in this paper, a novel learning model is proposed based on the combination of uncertaintybased active learning and semisupervised selftraining approaches to incorporate unlabelled sentiment documents from the target language in order to improve the performance of crosslingual methods. further, in this model, the density measures of unlabelled examples are considered in active learning part in order to avoid outlier selection. the empirical evaluation on book review datasets in three different languages shows that the proposed model can significantly improve the performance of crosslingual sentiment classification in comparison with other existing and baseline methods.	2	5.0
neural sentiment classification with user and product attention	documentlevel sentiment classification aims to predict user's overall sentiment in a doc ument about a product. however, most of existing methods only focus on local text in formation and ignore the global user pref erence and product characteristics. even though some works take such information into account, they usually suffer from high model complexity and only consider word level preference rather than semantic levels. to address this issue, we propose a hierarchi cal neural network to incorporate global user and product information into sentiment clas sification. our model first builds a hierar chical lstm model to generate sentence and document representations. afterwards, user and product information is considered via at tentions over different semantic levels due to its ability of capturing crucial semantic com ponents. the experimental results show that our model achieves significant and consistent improvements compared to all stateofthe art methods. the source code of this paper can be obtained from https//github. com/thunlp/nsc.	3	5.0
sentiment classification of online reviews: using sentence-based language model	with the development of social media, the increasing online reviews of products are greatly influencing the electronic market, making sentiment classification the topic of interest for both industry and academia. this paper develops a sentencebased language model to perform sentiment classification at a finegrained sentence level. the proposed approach applies a machine learning method to determine the sentiment polarity of a sentence at first, then designs statistical algorithm to compute the weight of the sentence in sentiment classification of the whole document and at last aggregates the weighted sentence to predict the sentiment polarity of document. besides, experiments are carried out on corpuses in different evaluation domains and languages, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sentencebased approach in obtaining a more accurate result of sentiment classification across different reviews. furthermore, the experimental results also indicate that the position and the sentiment of a sentence have great impact on predicting the sentiment polarity of document, and corpuses with different evaluative objects, languages and sentiments also greatly influence the performance of sentiment classification. it is believed that these conclusions will be a good inspiration for similar researches.	1	3.5
a statistical parsing framework for sentiment classification	we present a statistical parsing framework for sentencelevel sentiment classification in this article. unlike previous works that employ syntactic parsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to directly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence. we show that complicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification, and contrast) can be handled the same as simple and straightforward sentiment expressions in a unified and probabilistic way. we formulate the sentiment grammar upon contextfree grammars (cfgs), and provide a formal description of the sentiment parsing framework. we develop the parsing model to obtain possible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is proposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model is dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree. we train the parser directly from examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but without any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents within sentences. therefore we can obtain training data easily. in particular, we train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences with users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels. extensive experiments on existing benchmark datasets show significant improvements over baseline sentiment classification approaches.	1	3.75
attention-based lstm for aspect-level sentiment classification	aspectlevel sentiment classification is a fine grained task in sentiment analysis. since it provides more complete and indepth results, aspectlevel sentiment analysis has received much attention these years. in this paper, we reveal that the sentiment polarity of a sentence is not only determined by the content but is also highly related to the concerned aspect. for instance, the appetizers are ok, but the service is slow., for aspect taste, the polar ity is positive while for service, the polarity is negative. therefore, it is worthwhile to ex plore the connection between an aspect and the content of a sentence. to this end, we propose an attentionbased long shortterm memory network for aspectlevel sentiment classification. the attention mechanism can concentrate on different parts of a sentence when different aspects are taken as input. we experiment on the semeval 2014 dataset and results show that our model achieves stateof theart performance on aspectlevel sentiment classification.	3	4.5

adversarial deep averaging networks for cross-lingual sentiment classification	in recent years deep neural networks have achieved great success in sentiment classification for english, thanks in part to the availability of copious annotated resources. unfortunately, most other languages do not enjoy such an abundance of annotated data for sentiment analysis. to tackle this problem, we propose the adversarial deep averaging network (adan) to transfer sentiment knowledge learned from labeled english data to lowresource languages where only unlabeled data exists. adan is a yshaped network with two discriminative branches a sentiment classifier and an adversarial language identification scorer. both branches take input from a shared feature extractor that aims to learn hidden representations that capture the underlying sentiment of the text and are invariant across languages. experiments on chinese and arabic sentiment classification demonstrate that adan significantly outperforms several baselines, including a strong pipeline approach that relies on stateoftheart machine translation.	3	5.0
enhanced twitter sentiment classification using contextual information	the rise in popularity and ubiquity of twitter has made sentiment analysis of tweets an important and wellcovered area of research. however, the 140 character limit imposed on tweets makes it hard to use standard linguistic methods for sentiment classification. on the other hand, what tweets lack in structure they make up with sheer volume and rich metadata. this metadata includes geolocation, temporal and author information. we hypothesize that sentiment is dependent on all these contextual factors. different locations, times and authors have different emotional valences. in this paper, we explored this hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision to collect millions of labelled tweets from different locations, times and authors. we used this data to analyse the variation of tweet sentiments across different authors, times and locations. once we explored and understood the relationship between these variables and sentiment, we used a bayesian approach to combine these variables with more standard linguistic features such as ngrams to create a twitter sentiment classifier. this combined classifier outperforms the purely linguistic classifier, showing that integrating the rich contextual information available on twitter into sentiment classification is a promising direction of research.	2	3.6666666666666665
sentiment classification on polarity reviews: an empirical study using rating-based features	we present a new feature type named ratingbased feature and evaluate the contribution of this feature to the task of documentlevel sentiment analysis. we achieve stateoftheart results on two publicly available standard polarity movie datasets on the dataset consisting of 2000 reviews produced by pang and lee (2004) we obtain an accuracy of 91.6% while it is 89.87% evaluated on the dataset of 50000 reviews created by maas et al. (2011). we also get a performance at 93.24% on our own dataset consisting of 233600 movie reviews, and we aim to share this dataset for further research in sentiment polarity analysis task.	1	2.75
personalized sentiment classification based on latent individuality of microblog users	sentiment expression in microblog posts often reflects user's specific individuality due to different language habit, personal character, opinion bias and so on. existing sentiment classification algorithms largely ignore such latent personal distinctions among different microblog users. meanwhile, sentiment data of microblogs are sparse for individual users, making it infeasible to learn effective personalized classifier. in this paper, we propose a novel, extensible personalized sentiment classification method based on a variant of latent factor model to capture personal sentiment variations by mapping users and posts into a lowdimensional factor space. we alleviate the sparsity of personal texts by decomposing the posts into words which are further represented by the weighted sentiment and topic units based on a set of syntactic units of words obtained from dependency parsing results. to strengthen the representation of users, we leverage users following relation to consolidate the individuality of a user fused from other users with similar interests. results on realworld microblog datasets confirm that our method outperforms stateoftheart baseline algorithms with large margins.	2	3.6666666666666665
improving twitter sentiment classification using topic-enriched multi-prototype word embeddings	it has been shown that learning distributed word representations is highly useful for twitter sentiment classification.most existing models rely on a single distributed representation for each word.this is problematic for sentiment classification because words are often polysemous and each word can contain different sentiment polarities under different topics.we address this issue by learning topicenriched multiprototype word embeddings (tmwe).in particular, we develop two neural networks which 1) learn word embeddings that better capture tweet context by incorporating topic information, and 2) learn topicenriched multiple prototype embeddings for each word.experiments on twitter sentiment benchmark datasets in semeval 2013 show that tmwe outperforms the top system with handcrafted features, and the current best neural network model.	3	4.0
detecting adverse drug reactions using a sentiment classification framework	medical blogs and forums are a source of sentimentoriented content that is used in diverse applicationsincluding postmarketing drug surveillance, competitive intelligence and the assessment of healthrelatedopinions and sentiments for detecting adverse drugreactions. however applying existing tools for sentiment analysis to healthrelated datasets provides inadequate classification accuracy. these methodsemploy less useful features sets and therefore lackdiscriminatory potential. in this study we proposea framework that uses feature set ensembles withnovel feature representations that reduce sparsity byadding representational richness. our framework extracts important semantic, sentiment, and affect cues,that are better able to reflect the experiences of people when they discuss adverse drug reactions as well as the severity and the emotional impact of their experiences. experiments conducted on a test bed ofhealth2.0 datasets, demonstrate improved classification accuracy in comparison to existing techniques.furthermore, the proposed framework is able to detect adverse drug events earlier, and with higher recall than comparison methods, thereby demonstrating its utility for social media based postmarketing drug surveillance.	1	2.75
pos-rs: a random subspace method for sentiment classification based on part-of-speech analysis	with the rise of web 2.0 platforms, personal opinions, such as reviews, ratings, recommendations, and other forms of usergenerated content, have fueled interest in sentiment classification in both academia and industry. in order to enhance the performance of sentiment classification, ensemble methods have been investigated by previous research and proven to be effective theoretically and empirically. we advance this line of research by proposing an enhanced random subspace method, posrs, for sentiment classification based on partofspeech analysis. unlike existing random subspace methods using a single subspace rate to control the diversity of base learners, posrs employs two important parameters, i.e. content lexicon subspace rate and function lexicon subspace rate, to control the balance between the accuracy and diversity of base learners. ten publicly available sentiment datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of proposed method. empirical results reveal that posrs achieves the best performance through reducing bias and variance simultaneously compared to the base learner, i.e., support vector machine. these results illustrate that posrs can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification and has the potential of being successfully applied to other text classification problems.	2	3.6666666666666665
bi-view semi-supervised active learning for cross-lingual sentiment classification	recently, sentiment classification has received considerable attention within the natural language processing research community. however, since most recent works regarding sentiment classification have been done in the english language, there are accordingly not enough sentiment resources in other languages. manual construction of reliable sentiment resources is a very difficult and timeconsuming task. crosslingual sentiment classification aims to utilize annotated sentiment resources in one language (typically english) for sentiment classification of text documents in another language. most existing research works rely on automatic machine translation services to directly project information from one language to another. however, different term distribution between original and translated text documents and translation errors are two main problems faced in the case of using only machine translation. to overcome these problems, we propose a novel learning model based on active learning and semisupervised cotraining to incorporate unlabelled data from the target language into the learning process in a biview framework. this model attempts to enrich training data by adding the most confident automaticallylabelled examples, as well as a few of the most informative manuallylabelled examples from unlabelled data in an iterative process. further, in this model, we consider the density of unlabelled data so as to select more representative unlabelled examples in order to avoid outlier selection in active learning. the proposed model was applied to book review datasets in three different languages.	1	2.75

learning bilingual sentiment word embeddings for cross-language sentiment classification	the sentiment classification performance relies on highquality sentiment resources. however, these resources are imbalanced in different languages. crosslanguage sentiment classification (clsc) can leverage the rich resources in one language (source language) for sentiment classification in a resourcescarce language (target language). bilingual embeddings could eliminate the semantic gap between two languages for clsc, but ignore the sentiment information of text. this paper proposes an approach to learning bilingual sentiment word embeddings (bswe) for englishchinese clsc. the proposed bswe incorporate sentiment information of text into bilingual embeddings. furthermore , we can learn highquality bswe by simply employing labeled corpora and their translations, without relying on largescale parallel corpora. experiments on nlp&cc 2013 clsc dataset show that our approach outperforms the stateoftheart systems.	2	3.0

different feature selection for sentiment classification	sentiment analysis (sa) research has increased tremendously in recent times .sentiment analysis means to extract opinion of users from review documents. sentiment classification using machine learning (ml ) methods faces the problem of high dimensionality of feature vector. therefore, a feature selection method is required to eliminate the irrelevant and noisy features from the feature vector for efficient working of ml algorithms rough set theory provides an important concept for feature reduction called reduct. the cost of reduct set computation is highly influenced by the attribute size of the dataset where the problem of finding reducts has been proven as np hard problems.different feature selection are applied on different data set, experimental results show that mrmr is better compared to ig for sentiment classification, hybrid feature selection method based on the rst and information gain (ig) is better compared to the previous methods. proposed methods are evaluated on four standard datasets viz. movie review, product (book, dvd, and electronics) reviewed datasets, and experimental results show that hybrid feature selection method outperforms than feature selection methods for sentimental classification.	1	2.25
a hybrid approach for sentiment classification of egyptian dialect tweets	sentiment analysis has recently become one of the growing areas of research related to text mining and natural language processing. the main task of sentiment classification is to classify a sentence (i.e. tweet, review, blog, comment, news, etc.) as holding an overall positive, negative or neutral sentiment. most of the current studies related to this topic focus mainly on english texts with very limited resources available for other languages like arabic, especially for the egyptian dialect. in this research work, we would like to improve the performance measures of egyptian dialect sentencelevel sentiment analysis by proposing a hybrid approach which combines both the machine learning approach using support vector machines and the semantic orientation approach. two methodologies were proposed, one for each approach, which were then joined, creating the hybrid proposed approach. the results obtained show significant improvements in terms of the accuracy, precision, recall and fmeasure, indicating that our proposed hybrid approach is effective in sentencelevel sentiment classification. also, the results are very promising which encourages continuing in this line of research.	2	2.6666666666666665
an ensemble sentiment classification system of twitter data for airline services analysis	in airline service industry, it is difficult to collect data about customers' feedback by questionnaires, but twitter provides a sound data source for them to do customer sentiment analysis. however, little research has been done in the domain of twitter sentiment classification about airline services. in this paper, an ensemble sentiment classification strategy was applied based on majority vote principle of multiple classification methods, including naive bayes, svm, bayesian network, c4.5 decision tree and random forest algorithms. in our experiments, six individual classification approaches, and the proposed ensemble approach were all trained and tested using the same dataset of 12864 tweets, in which 10 fold evaluation is used to validate the classifiers. the results show that the proposed ensemble approach outperforms these individual classifiers in this airline service twitter dataset. based on our observations, the ensemble approach could improve the overall accuracy in twitter sentiment classification for other services as well.	3	3.5

impact of feature selection techniques for tweet sentiment classification	sentiment analysis of tweets is a powerful application of mining social media sites that can be used for a variety of social sensing tasks. common feature engineering techniques frequently result in a large numbers of features being generated to represent tweets. many of these features may degrade classifier performance and increasing computational cost. feature selection techniques can be used to select an optimal subset of features, reducing the computational cost of training a classifier, and potentially improving classification performance. despite its benefits, feature selection has received little attention within the tweet sentiment domain. we study the impact of ten filterbased feature selection techniques on classification performance, using ten feature subset sizes and four different learners. our experimental results demonstrate that feature selection can significantly improve classification performance in comparison to not using feature selection. additionally, both choice of ranker and feature subset size significantly impact classifier performance. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which extensively studies feature selections effect on tweet sentiment classification.	2	2.6666666666666665
machine learning and lexicon based methods for sentiment classification: a survey	sentiment classification is an important subject in text mining research, which concerns the application of automatic methods for predicting the orientation of sentiment present on text documents, with many applications on a number of areas including recommender and advertising systems, customer intelligence and information retrieval. in this paper, we provide a survey and comparative study of existing techniques for opinion mining including machine learning and lexiconbased approaches, together with evaluation metrics. also crossdomain and crosslingual approaches are explored. experimental results show that supervised machine learning methods, such as svm and naive bayes, have higher precision, while lexiconbased methods are also very competitive because they require few effort in humanlabeled document and isn't sensitive to the quantity and quality of the training dataset.	2	3.0

a comparative analysis of opinion mining and sentiment classification in non-english languages	in the past decade many opinion mining and sentiment classification studies have been carried out for opinions in english. however, the amount of work done for nonenglish text opinions is very limited. in this review, we investigate opinion mining and sentiment classification studies in three nonenglish languages to find the classification methods and the efficiency of each algorithm used in these methods. it is found that most of the research conducted for nonenglish has followed the methods used in the english language with only limited usage of language specific properties, such as morphological variations. the application domains seem to be restricted to particular fields and significantly less research has been conducted in cross domains.	1	2.25
a fuzzy logic based sentiment classification	sentiment classification aims to detect information such as opinions, explicit , implicit feelings expressed in text. the most existing approaches are able to detect either explicit expressions or implicit expressions of sentiments in the text separately. in this proposed framework it will detect both implicit and explicit expressions available in the meeting transcripts. it will classify the positive, negative, neutral words and also identify the topic of the particular meeting transcripts by using fuzzy logic. this paper aims to add some additional features for improving the classification method. the quality of the sentiment classification is improved using proposed fuzzy logic framework .in this fuzzy logic it includes the features like fuzzy rules and fuzzy cmeans algorithm.the quality of the output is evaluated using the parameters such as precision, recall, fmeasure. here fuzzy cmeans clustering technique measured in terms of purity and entropy. the data set was validated using 10fold cross validation method and observed 95% confidence interval between the accuracy values .finally, the proposed fuzzy logic method produced more than 85 % accurate results and error rate is very less compared to existing sentiment classification techniques.	1	2.0
collaborative multi-domain sentiment classification	sentiment classification is a hot research topic in both industrial and academic fields. the mainstream sentiment classification methods are based on machine learning and treat sentiment classification as a text classification problem. however, sentiment classification is widely recognized as a highly domaindependent task. the sentiment classifier trained in one domain may not perform well in another domain. a simple solution to this problem is training a domainspecific sentiment classifier for each domain. however, it is difficult to label enough data for every domain since they are in a large quantity. in addition, this method omits the sentiment information in other domains. in this paper, we propose to train sentiment classifiers for multiple domains in a collaborative way based on multitask learning. specifically, we decompose the sentiment classifier in each domain into two components, a general one and a domainspecific one. the general sentiment classifier can capture the global sentiment information and is trained across various domains to obtain better generalization ability. the domainspecific sentiment classifier is trained using the labeled data in one domain to capture the domainspecific sentiment information. in addition, we explore two kinds of relations between domains, one based on textual content and the other one based on sentiment word distribution. we build a domain similarity graph using domain relations and encode it into our approach as regularization over the domainspecific sentiment classifiers. besides, we incorporate the sentiment knowledge extracted from sentiment lexicons to help train the general sentiment classifier more accurately.	3	3.0
chinese sentiment classification using a neural network tool — word2vec	sentiment classification is the main and popular task in the field of sentiment analysis. most of the existing researches focus on how to extract the effective features, such as lexical features and syntactic features, while limited work has been done on the extraction of semantic features, which can make more contributions to sentiment classification. this paper presents a method for sentiment classification based on word2vec. word2vec is a tool, which establishes the neural network models to learn the vector representations of words in the high dimensional vector space. so it can extract the deep semantic relationships between words. in this paper, firstly, we cluster the similar features together using word2vec. and then we use word2vec again to learn the word representations as candidate feature vectors. after feature selection, the svmperf package is adopted to train and classify the comment texts. to conduct the experiments, we collect a large number of chinese comments on clothing products as data set. the experimental results show that the accuracy of sentiment classification is over 90 percent, which proves the effectiveness of proposed method for chinese sentiment classification.	1	2.0
an ensemble sentiment classification system of twitter data for airline services analysis	in airline service industry, it is difficult to collect data about customers' feedback by questionnaires, but twitter provides a sound data source for them to do customer sentiment analysis. however, little research has been done in the domain of twitter sentiment classification about airline services. in this paper, an ensemble sentiment classification strategy was applied based on majority vote principle of multiple classification methods, including naive bayes, svm, bayesian network, c4.5 decision tree and random forest algorithms. in our experiments, six individual classification approaches, and the proposed ensemble approach were all trained and tested using the same dataset of 12864 tweets, in which 10 fold evaluation is used to validate the classifiers. the results show that the proposed ensemble approach outperforms these individual classifiers in this airline service twitter dataset. based on our observations, the ensemble approach could improve the overall accuracy in twitter sentiment classification for other services as well.	2	2.3333333333333335
sentiment classification in under-resourced languages using graph-based semi-supervised learning methods	in sentiment classification, conventional supervised approaches heavily rely on a large amount of linguistic resources, which are costly to obtain for underresourced languages. to overcome this scarce resource problem, there exist several methods that exploit graphbased semisupervised learning (ssl). however, fundamental issues such as controlling label propagation, choosing the initial seeds, selecting edges have barely been studied. our evaluation on three real datasets demonstrates that manipulating the label propagating behavior and choosing labeled seeds appropriately play a critical role in adopting graphbased ssl approaches for this task.	1	1.75

cross-lingual sentiment classification using multiple source languages in multi-view semi-supervised learning	crosslingual sentiment classification aims to utilize annotated sentiment resources in one language (typically english) for sentiment classification of text documents in another language. most existing research works rely on automatic machine translation services to directly project information from one language to another. however, due to the existence of differing linguistic terms and writing styles between different languages, translated data cannot cover all vocabularies which exist in the original data. further, different term distribution between translated data and original data can lead to low performance in crosslingual sentiment classification. to overcome these problems, we propose a new model which uses labelled data from multiple source languages in a multiview semisupervised learning approach so as to incorporate unlabelled data from the target language into the learning process. the proposed model was applied to book review datasets in four different languages. experiments have shown that our model can effectively improve the crosslingual sentiment classification performance in comparison with some baseline methods.	1	2.0
a comparative performance evaluation of neural network based approach for sentiment classification of online reviews	the aim of sentiment classification is to efficiently identify the emotions expressed in the form of text messages. machine learning methods for sentiment classification have been extensively studied, due to their predominant classification performance. recent studies suggest that ensemble based machine learning methods provide better performance in classification. artificial neural networks (anns) are rarely being investigated in the literature of sentiment classification. this paper compares neural network based sentiment classification methods (back propagation neural network (bpn), probabilistic neural network (pnn) & homogeneous ensemble of pnn (hen)) using varying levels of word granularity as features for feature level sentiment classification. they are validated using a dataset of product reviews collected from the amazon reviews website. an empirical analysis is done to compare results of ann based methods with two statistical individual methods. the methods are evaluated using five different quality measures and results show that the homogeneous ensemble of the neural network method provides better performance. among the two neural network approaches used, probabilistic neural networks (pnns) outperform in classifying the sentiment of the product reviews. the integration of neural network based sentiment classification methods with principal component analysis (pca) as a feature reduction technique provides superior performance in terms of training time also.	3	3.0
a sentiment classification model based on multiple classifiers	with the widespread usage of social networks, forums and blogs, customer reviews emerged as a critical factor for the customers鈥 purchase decisions. since the beginning of 2000s, researchers started to focus on these reviews to automatically categorize them into polarity levels such as positive, negative, and neutral. this research problem is known as sentiment classification. the objective of this study is to investigate the potential benefit of multiple classifier systems concept on turkish sentiment classification problem and propose a novel classification technique. vote algorithm has been used in conjunction with three classifiers, namely naive bayes, support vector machine (svm), and bagging. parameters of the svm have been optimized when it was used as an individual classifier. experimental results showed that multiple classifier systems increase the performance of individual classifiers on turkish sentiment classification datasets and meta classifiers contribute to the power of these multiple classifier systems. the proposed approach achieved better performance than naive bayes, which was reported the best individual classifier for these datasets, and support vector machines. multiple classifier systems (mcs) is a good approach for sentiment classification, and parameter optimization of individual classifiers must be taken into account while developing mcsbased prediction systems.	4	5.0
sentiment classification technology based on markov logic networks	with diverse online media emerging, there is a growing concern of sentiment classification problem. at present, text sentiment classification mainly utilizes supervised machine learning methods, which feature certain domain dependency. on the basis of markov logic networks (mlns), this study proposed a crossdomain multitask text sentiment classification method rooted in transfer learning. through manytoone knowledge transfer, labeled text sentiment classification, knowledge was successfully transferred into other domains, and the precision of the sentiment classification analysis in the text tendency domain was improved. the experimental results revealed the following (1) the model based on a mln demonstrated higher precision than the single individual learning plan model. (2) multitask transfer learning based on markov logical networks could acquire more knowledge than selfdomain learning. the crossdomain text sentiment classification model could significantly improve the precision and efficiency of text sentiment classification.	3	2.5

combination of multi-view multi-source language classifiers for cross-lingual sentiment classification	crosslingual sentiment classification aims to conduct sentiment classification in a target language using labeled sentiment data in a source language. most existing research works rely on machine translation to directly project information from one language to another. but crosslingual classifiers always cannot learn all characteristics of target language data by using only translated data from one language. in this paper, we propose a new learning model that uses labeled sentiment data from more than one language to compensate some of the limitations of resource translation. in this model, we first create different views of sentiment data via machine translation, then train individual classifiers in every view and finally combine the classifiers for final decision. we have applied this model to the sentiment classification datasets in three different languages using different combination methods. the results show that the combination methods improve the performances obtained separately by each individual classifier.	1	1.75
sentiment classification of online political discussions	online political discussions have received a lot of attention over the past years. in this paper we compare two sentiment lexicon approaches to classify the sentiment of sentences from political discussions. the first approach is based on applying the number of words between the target and the sentiment words to weight the sentence sentiment score. the second approach is based on using the shortest paths between target and sentiment words in a dependency graph and linguistically motivated syntactic patterns expressed as dependency paths. the methods are tested on a corpus of sentences from online norwegian political discussions. the results show that the method based on dependency graphs performs significantly better than the wordbased approach.	1	1.5
sentiment classification using enhanced contextual valence shifters	we have explored different methods of improving the accuracy of sentiment classification. the sentiment orientation of a document can be positive (+), negative (), or neutral (0). we combine five dictionaries from [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] into the new one with 21137 entries. the new dictionary has many verbs, adverbs, phrases and idioms, that are not in five ones before. the paper shows that our proposed method based on the combination of termcounting method and enhanced contextual valence shifters method has improved the accuracy of sentiment classification. the combined method has accuracy 68.984% on the testing dataset, and 69.224% on the training dataset. all of these methods are implemented to classify the reviews based on our new dictionary and the internet movie data set.	1	1.5

semantic orientation approach for sentiment classification	opinions are the fundamental aspect to almost all decision making activities. the increased usage of internet and the exchange of user opinions through social media and public forums on the web has become the motivation for sentiment analysis. due to the infinite amount of user opinions available throughout the web it is necessary to automatically analyze and classify sentiment expressed in opinions. the basic task of sentiment analysis or opinion mining is sentiment classification which classifies the content as positive, negative and irrelevant. this paper discusses an approach where an exposed stream of tweets from the twitter micro blogging site are preprocessed and classified based on their sentiments. in sentiment classification system the concept of opinion subjectivity has been accounted. in this paper, we present opinion detection and organization subsystem, which have already been integrated into our larger questionanswering system. the subjectivity classification system uses geneticbased machine learning (gbml) technique that considers subjectivity as a semantic problem. the classification of a review is predicted through the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. experimental results of the proposed techniques are efficient and generate eminent evaluations.	1	1.5
sentitfidf – sentiment classification using relative term frequency inverse document frequency	sentiment classification refers to the computational techniques for classifying whether the sentiments of text are positive or negative. statistical techniques based on term presence and term frequency, using support vector machine are popularly used for sentiment classification. this paper presents an approach for classifying a term as positive or negative based on its proportional frequency count distribution and proportional presence count distribution across positively tagged documents in comparison with negatively tagged documents. our approach is based on term weighting techniques that are used for information retrieval and sentiment classification. it differs significantly from these traditional methods due to our model of logarithmic differential term frequency and term presence distribution for sentiment classification. terms with nearly equal distribution in positively tagged documents and negatively tagged documents were classified as a sentistopword and discarded. the proportional distribution of a term to be classified as sentistopword was determined experimentally. we evaluated the sentitfidf model by comparing it with state of art techniques for sentiment classification using the movie dataset.	1	1.5
density based active self-training for cross-lingual sentiment classification	crosslingual sentiment classification aims to utilize annotated sentiment resources in one language (typically english) for sentiment classification in another language. most existing research works rely on automatic machine translation services to directly project information from one language to another. however, since machine translation quality is still far from satisfactory and also term distribution across languages may be dissimilar, these techniques cannot reach the performance of monolingual approaches. to overcome these limitations, we propose a novel learning model based on active learning and selftraining to incorporate unlabeled data from the target language into the learning process. further, in this model, we consider the density of unlabeled data to avoid outlier selection in active learning. the proposed model was applied to book review datasets in two different languages. experiments showed that the proposed model could effectively reduce labeling efforts in comparison with some baseline methods.	1	1.5
using unsupervised information to improve semi-supervised tweet sentiment classification	supervised algorithms require a set of representative labeled data for building classification models. however, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semisupervised learning. this type of learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process and is particularly useful in applications such as tweet sentiment analysis, where a large amount of unlabeled data is available. semisupervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although quite appealing, is relatively new. we propose a semisupervised learning framework that combines unsupervised information, captured from a similarity matrix constructed from unlabeled data, with a classifier. our motivation is that such a similarity matrix is a powerful knowledgediscovery tool that can help classify unlabeled tweet sets. our framework makes use of the wellknown selftraining algorithm to induce a better tweet sentiment classifier. experimental results in realworld datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve the accuracy of tweet sentiment analysis.	3	2.0
cached long short-term memory neural networks for document-level sentiment classification	recently, neural networks have achieved great success on sentiment classification due to their ability to alleviate feature engineering. however, one of the remaining challenges is to model long texts in documentlevel sentiment classification under a recurrent architecture because of the deficiency of the memory unit. to address this problem, we present a cached long shortterm memory neural networks (clstm) to capture the overall semantic information in long texts. clstm introduces a cache mechanism, which divides memory into several groups with different forgetting rates and thus enables the network to keep sentiment information better within a recurrent unit. the proposed clstm outperforms the stateoftheart models on three publicly available documentlevel sentiment analysis datasets.	3	2.0

structured microblog sentiment classification via social context regularization	microblog sentiment analysis is a fundamental problem for many interesting applications. existing microblog sentiment classification methods judge the sentiment polarity mainly according to textual content. however, since microblog messages are very short and noisy, and their sentiment polarities are often ambiguous and contextdependent, the accuracy of microblog sentiment classification is usually unsatisfactory. fortunately, microblog messages lie in social media and contain rich social contexts. the social context information often implies sentiment connections between microblog messages. for example, a microblogging user usually expresses the same sentiment when posting multiple messages towards the same topic. motivated by these observations, in this paper we propose a structured microblog sentiment classification (smsc) framework. our framework can combine social context information with textual content information to improve microblog sentiment classification accuracy. two kinds of social contexts are used in our framework, i.e., social connections between microblog messages brought by the same author and social connections brought by social relations between users. in our framework, social context information is formulated as the graph structure over the sentiments of microblog messages. the objective function of our framework is a tradeoff between the agreement with contentbased sentiment predictions and the consistency with social contexts. an efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to solve our framework. experimental results on two twitter sentiment analysis benchmark datasets indicate that our method can outperform baseline methods consistently and significantly.	3	2.0

sentiment classification using subjective and objective views	this work proposes a new semisupervised sentiment classification method by exploiting a large number of unlabeled instances to conduct sentiment classification for web consumer reviews. in the proposed method every consumer review has two views subjective view and objective view. the subjective view of a consumer review reflects the opinions expressed by opinion words, while the objective view is constructed by the remaining text features. this work is trying to combine two kinds of views to carry out sentiment classification. the method is based on the cotraining framework which needs three basic sentiment classifiers to iteratively get the final sentiment classifier. in the proposed method, the first sentiment classifier is constructed using the common unigram features coming from consumer reviews. the second sentiment classifier is trained on the subjective views constructed by opinion words extracted from consumer reviews. the remaining text features of these reviews are used for obtaining the objective views which can be trained for the third classifier. experimental results show the proposed method is effective, and it has better performance than the selflearning svm method.	1	1.25
target-dependent sentiment classification with long short term memory	targetdependent sentiment classification remains a challenge modeling the semantic relatedness of a target with its context words in a sentence. different context words have different influences on determining the sentiment polarity of a sentence towards the target. therefore, it is desirable to integrate the connections between target word and context words when building a learning system. in this paper, we develop two target dependent long shortterm memory (lstm) models, where target information is automatically taken into account. we evaluate our methods on a benchmark dataset from twitter. empirical results show that modeling sentence representation with standard lstm does not perform well. incorporating target information into lstm can significantly boost the classification accuracy. the targetdependent lstm models achieve stateoftheart performances without using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons.	2	1.6666666666666667
cross-domain sentiment classification via topical correspondence transfer	sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of user generated sentiment data (e.g., reviews, blogs). in real applications, these users generated sentiment data can span so many different domains that it is difficult to manually label training data for all of them. in this article, we develop a general solution to crossdomain sentiment classification when we do not have any labeled data in a target domain but have some labeled data in a source domain. to bridge the gap between domains, we propose a novel algorithm, called topical correspondence transfer (tct). this is achieved by learning the domainspecific information from different domains into unified topics, with the help of shared topics across all domains. in this way, the topical correspondences behind the shared topics can be used as a bridge to reduce the gap between domains. we conduct experiments on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of amazon products. experimental results show that our proposed tct significantly outperforms the baseline method, and achieves an accuracy which is competitive with the stateoftheart methods for crossdomain sentiment classification.	2	1.6666666666666667
role of emotion icons in sentiment classification of arabic tweets	in recent years, there is enormous increase of data content due to emergence of social media platforms in digital word of internet. the text mining is very important technique to discover the knowledge from unstructured data. automatic sentiment analysis is one of the important applications of text mining. the sentiment analysis is used to predict the text polarity (positive, negative, and neutral). furthermore, the most of users using social media such as twitter use informal language to express their opinions. in this paper, we propose an automatic approach to predict sentiments for informal arabic language. we chose arabic tweets as input for our study. we observed through our experiment results that although emotion icons presence in the tweets helps in development of comparatively more accurate classifier, however they play ambiguous role in defining the sentiments of tweets.	1	1.25
fuzzy sentiment membership determining for sentiment classification	traditional support vector machine treats all samples using the same weight. therefore it is very sensitive to noisy data. while the fuzzy support vector machine assigns lower weights to the samples which make small contributions to classification, thus it is beneficial to reduce the effects of noisy and unimportant data on the classification accuracy rate. in this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy sentiment membership determining method for solving sentiment classification task. we assume that strong intensity texts make more contributions to sentiment classification, while weak intensity texts are unimportant for the classification. in order to get the fuzzy sentiment membership of review texts, this paper proposes a threelayer sentiment propagation model. firstly, we calculate the sentiment score of texts by the interrelations of the texts, topics and words, and ensure that the absolute value of sentiment score as the fuzzy sentiment membership degree of texts. then, we train a fuzzy support vector machine to classify the samples from the test data sets. finally, we conduct some experiments on four english reviews data sets from amazon shopping websites. the experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of sentiment classification effectively.	2	1.6666666666666667

facebook users relationships analysis based on sentiment classification	it is presented an approach aimed at analyzing the homepage of a facebook user or group in order to automatically detect who has discussed what and how it has been discussed. all public posts shared by an user are retrieved by an ad hoc built crawler. information such as a text messages, comments, likes, is extracted for each post. each post is classified as belonging to a set of predefined categories and its sentiment is also detected as being positive, negative or neutral. all the comments to that post are therefore analyzed and categorized together with its sentiment polarity. for each category it is created a graph where it is highlighted the concordance of sentiment between the posts and the related comments. the graph can be therefore used to profile the user relationships according to sentiment classification.	1	1.25
a comparative study of feature selection and machine learning algorithms for arabic sentiment classification	sentiment analysis is a very challenging and important task that involves natural language processing, web mining, and machine learning. sentiment analysis in the arabic language is a more challenging task than in other languages due to the morphological complexity of the arabic and the large variation of its dialects. this paper presents an empirical comparison of seven feature selection methods (information gain, principal components analysis, relieff, gini index, uncertainty, chisquared, and support vector machines (svms)), and three machine learning classifiers (svm, naive bayes, and knearest neighbor) for arabic sentiment classification. a wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on an opinion corpus for arabic (oca). this paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of arabic sentimentbased classification, but the result depends on the method used and the number of features selected. the experimental results demonstrate that feature reduction methods are found to improve the classifier performance. moreover, the experimental results indicate that svmbased feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the svm classifier outperforms the other techniques for arabic sentimentbased classification. finally, the experiments indicate that the svm classifier with the svmbased feature selection method yields the best classification method, with an accuracy of 92.4%.	1	1.25
sentiment classification: an approach for indian language tweets using decision tree	this paper describes the system we used for shared task on sentiment analysis in indian languages (sail) tweets, at mike2015. twitter is one of the most popular platform which allows users to share their opinion in the form of tweets. since it restricts the users with 140 characters, the tweets are actually very short to carry opinions and sentiments to analyze. we take the help of a twitter training dataset in indian language (hindi) and apply data mining approaches for analyzing the sentiments. we used a stateoftheart data mining tool weka to automatically classify the sentiment of hindi tweets into positive, negative or neutral.	2	1.3333333333333333

lcct: a semi-supervised model for sentiment classification	analyzing public opinions towards products, services and social events is an important but challenging task. an accurate sentiment analyzer should take both lexiconlevel information and corpuslevel information into account. it also needs to exploit the domainspecific knowledge and utilize the common knowledge shared across domains. in addition, we want the algorithm being able to deal with missing labels and learning from incomplete sentiment lexicons. this paper presents a lcct (lexiconbased and corpusbased, cotraining) model for semisupervised sentiment classification. the proposed method combines the idea of lexiconbased learning and corpusbased learning in a unified cotraining framework. it is capable of incorporating both domainspecific and domainindependent knowledge. extensive experiments show that it achieves very competitive classification accuracy, even with a small portion of labeled data. comparing to stateoftheart sentiment classification methods, the lcct approach exhibits significantly better performances on a variety of datasets in both english and chinese. 漏 2015 association for computational linguistics	2	1.3333333333333333

distributional correspondence indexing for cross-lingual and cross-domain sentiment classification	summary domain adaptation (da) techniques aim at enabling machine learning methods learn effective classifiers for a “target” domain when the only available training data belongs to a different “source” domain. in this paper we present the distributional correspondence indexing (dci) method for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. dci derives term representations in a vector space common to both domains where each dimension reflects its distributional correspondence to a pivot, i.e., to a highly predictive term that behaves similarly across domains. term correspondence is quantified by means of a distributional correspondence function (dcf). we propose a number of efficient dcfs that are motivated by the distributional hypothesis, i.e., the hypothesis according to which terms with similar meaning tend to have similar distributions in text. experiments show that dci obtains better performance than current stateoftheart techniques for crosslingual and crossdomain sentiment classification. dci also brings about a significantly reduced computational cost, and requires a smaller amount of human intervention. as a final contribution, we discuss a more challenging formulation of the domain adaptation problem, in which both the crossdomain and crosslingual dimensions are tackled simultaneously.	3	1.5

transfer learning for cross-lingual sentiment classification with weakly shared deep neural networks	crosslingual sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of data in a labelscarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich language. the fundamental challenge of crosslingual learning stems from a lack of overlap between the feature spaces of source language data and that of target language data. to address this challenge, previous studies have been performed to make use of the translated resources for sentiment classification in the target language, and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the source language and the translated target language. in this paper, to address the above challenge, we present a novel deep neural network structure, called weakly shared deep neural networks (wsdnns), to transfer the crosslingual information from a source language to a target language. to share the sentiment labels between two languages, we build multiple weakly shared layers of features. it allows to represent both shared interlanguage features and languagespecific ones, making this structure more flexible and powerful in capturing the feature representations of bilingual languages jointly. we conduct a set of experiments with crosslingual sentiment classification tasks on multilingual amazon product reviews. the empirical results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the stateoftheart methods for crosslingual sentiment classification, especially when label data is scarce.	3	1.5

domain-specific sentiment classification via fusing sentiment knowledge from multiple sources	analyzing the sentiments in massive usergenerated online data, such as product reviews and microblogs, has become a hot research topic. it can help customers, companies and expert systems make more informed decisions. sentiment analysis is widely known as a domain dependent problem. different domains usually have different sentiment expressions and a general sentiment classifier is not suitable for all domains. a natural solution to this problem is to train a domainspecific sentiment classifier for each target domain. however, the labeled data in target domain is usually insufficient, and it is costly and timeconsuming to annotate enough samples. in order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach to train domainspecific sentiment classifiers by fusing the sentiment knowledge from multiple sources. sentiment information from four sources is extracted and fused in our approach. the first source is sentiment lexicons, which contain sentiment polarities of general sentiment words. the second source is the sentiment classifiers of multiple source domains. the third source is the unlabeled data in target domain, from which we extract domainspecific sentiment relations among words. the fourth source is the labeled data in target domain. we propose a unified framework to fuse these four kinds of sentiment knowledge and train domainspecific sentiment classifier for target domain. in addition, we present an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the model of our approach.	4	3.0
slangsd: building and using a sentiment dictionary of slang words for short-text sentiment classification	sentiment in social media is increasingly considered as an important resource for customer segmentation, market understanding, and tackling other socioeconomic issues. however, sentiment in social media is difficult to measure since usergenerated content is usually short and informal. although many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying slang sentiment words remains untackled. one of the reasons is that slang sentiment words are not available in existing dictionaries or sentiment lexicons. to this end, we propose to build the first sentiment dictionary of slang words to aid sentiment analysis of social media content. it is laborious and timeconsuming to collect and label the sentiment polarity of a comprehensive list of slang words. we present an approach to leverage web resources to construct an extensive slang sentiment word dictionary (slangsd) that is easy to maintain and extend. slangsd is publicly available for research purposes. we empirically show the advantages of using slangsd, the newlybuilt slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with an existing sentiment system.	3	1.5

jeam: a novel model for cross-domain sentiment classification based on emotion analysis	crossdomain sentiment classification (csc) aims at learning a sentiment classifier for unlabeled data in the target domain based on the labeled data from a different source domain. due to the differences of data distribution of two domains in terms of the raw features, the csc problem is difficult and challenging. previous researches mainly focused on concepts mining by clustering words across data domains, which ignored the importance of authors’ emotion contained in data, or the different representations of the emotion between domains. in this paper, we propose a novel framework to solve the csc problem, by modelling the emotion across domains. we first develop a probabilistic model named jeam to model author’s emotion state when writing. then, an em algorithm is introduced to solve the likelihood maximum problem and to obtain the latent emotion distribution of the author. finally, a supervised learning method is utilized to assign the sentiment polarity to a given online review. experiments show that our approach is effective and outperforms stateoftheart approaches.	2	1.0
a subspace learning framework for cross-lingual sentiment classification with partial parallel data	crosslingual sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of data in a labelscarce target language by exploiting labeled data from a labelrich language. the fundamental challenge of crosslingual learning stems from a lack of overlap between the feature spaces of the source language data and that of the target language data. to address this challenge, previous work in the literature mainly relies on the large amount of bilingual parallel corpora to bridge the language gap. in many real applications, however, it is often the case that we have some partial parallel data but it is an expensive and timeconsuming job to acquire large amount of parallel data on different languages. in this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning framework by leveraging the partial parallel data for crosslingual sentiment classification. the proposed approach is achieved by jointly learning the documentaligned review data and unaligned data from the source language and the target language via a nonnegative matrix factorization framework. we conduct a set of experiments with crosslingual sentiment classification tasks on multilingual amazon product reviews. our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed crosslingual approach.	2	1.0

cross-domain sentiment classification-feature divergence, polarity divergence or both?	sentiment classification, which aims to predict the polarity of users鈥 viewpoint hidden in reviews, is a domainspecific problem, it often fails to be tested in one domain as a classifier trained from another domain. it is hence significant and challenging for crossdomain sentiment classification due to the following two cases (1) the same feature is used to express different sentiments in different domains (we call itpolarity divergence), and (2) different features are used to express similar sentiments in different domains (we call itfeature divergence). existing efforts focus on the latter and consider little on the former. in this paper, we consider both cases in crossdomain sentiment classification and propose a novel algorithm by transferring the polarity of features (tpf). since the polarity of features is informative for sentiment classification, our algorithm transfers the polarity of features from the source domain to the target domain with the independent features as the bridge. it is worth to note that the polarities of independent features are reset when they are involved in the former case. in addition, the resetting of independent features鈥 polarities in our algorithm can also be used as a preprocessing step in existing efforts. empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms stateoftheart methods in crossdomain sentiment classification.	2	1.0
word sense disambiguation based sentiment lexicons for sentiment classification	sentiment analysis has attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners as wordofmouth (wom) has a significant influence on consumer behavior. one core task of sentiment analysis is the discovery of sentimental words. this can be done efficiently when an accurate and largescale sentiment lexicon is used. sentiwordnet is one such lexicon which defines each synonym set within wordnet with sentiment scores and orientation. as human language is ambiguous, an exact sense for a word in sentiwordnet needs to be justified according to the context in which the word occurs. however, most sentimentbased classification tasks extract sentimental words from sentiwordnet without dealing with word sense disambiguation (wsd), but directly adopt the sentiment score of the first sense or average sense. this paper proposes three wsd techniques based on the context of wom documents to build wsdbased sentiwordnet lexicons. the experiments demonstrate that an improvement is achieved when the proposed wsdbased sentiwordnet is used.	3	1.0

attention-based lstm network for cross-lingual sentiment classification	most of the stateoftheart sentiment classifi cation methods are based on supervised learn ing algorithms which require large amounts of manually labeled data. however, the labeled resources are usually imbalanced in different languages. crosslingual sentiment classification tackles the problem by adapting the sentiment resources in a resourcerich language to resourcepoor languages. in this study, we propose an attentionbased bilingual representation learning model which learns the distributed semantics of the documents in both the source and the target languages. in each language, we use long short term mem ory (lstm) network to model the documents, which has been proved to be very effective for word sequences. meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism for the bilingual lstm network. the sentencelevel attention model learns which sentences of a document are more important for determining the overall sentiment while the wordlevel attention model learns which words in each sentence are decisive. the proposed model achieves good results on a benchmark dataset using english as the source language and chinese as the target language.	3	1.0
deep belief networks with feature selection for sentiment classification	due to the complexity of human languages, most of sentiment classification algorithms are suffered from a hugescale dimension of vocabularies which are mostly noisy and redundant. deep belief networks (dbn) tackle this problem by learning useful information in input corpus with their several hidden layers. unfortunately, dbn is a timeconsuming and computationally expensive process for largescale applications. in this paper, a semisupervised learning algorithm, called deep belief networks with feature selection (dbnfs) is developed. using our chisquared based feature selection, the complexity of the vocabulary input is decreased since some irrelevant features are filtered which makes the learning phase of dbn more efficient. the experimental results of our proposed dbnfs shows that the proposed dbnfs can achieve higher classification accuracy and can speed up training time compared with others wellknown semisupervised learning algorithms.	4	2.0

unlocking super bowl insights: weighted word embeddings for twitter sentiment classification	sentiment classification plays an important role in sentiment analysis. it is challenging to develop an automatic method for classification problems without annotated training data. in this paper, we present a wwe (weighted word embeddings) method, which uses a continuous word representations algorithm (word2vec) to train a vector model. according to the cosine similarity between the vector of a word and the vectors of seed words, a polarity score of this word can be calculated. we then use the weighted polarity scores of words to compute a polarity score of the whole tweet. unlike the previous learningbased approaches, our method does not require annotated data gathered for the purpose of training models. we collected the super bowl 50 related tweets to demonstrate the wwe classification method. experiments are performed with promising outcomes.	3	1.0
leveraging latent sentiment constraint in probabilistic matrix factorization for cross-domain sentiment classification ☆	sentiment analysis is concerned with classifying a subjective text into positive or negative according to the opinion expressed in it. the performance of traditional sentiment classification algorithms rely heavily on manually labeled training data. however, not every domain has the labeled data because the labeling work is timeconsuming and expensive. in this paper, we propose a latent sentiment factorization (lsf) algorithm based on probabilistic matrix factorization technique for crossdomain sentiment classification. lsf works in the setting where there are only labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. it bridges the gap between domains by exploiting the sentiment correlations between domainshared and domainspecific words in a twodimensional sentiment space. experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the stateoftheart approaches.	3	1.0
sentiment classification using comprehensive attention recurrent models	sentiment classification has been a very hot topic in the field of natural language processing (nlp) and understanding in recent years. recurrent neural networks (rnn) is a widely used tool to deal with the classification problem of variablelength sentences. the standard rnn can only access the preceding context of a sentence. in this paper, a new architecture termed comprehensive attention recurrent neural networks (carnn) which can store preceding, succeeding and local contexts of any position in a sequence is developed. the bidirectional recurrent neural networks (brnn) is used to access the past and future information while a convolutional layer is employed to capture local information. the standard rnn is also replaced by two recently emerged rnn variants, namely long shortterm memory (lstm) and gated recurrent unit (gru), to enhance the effectiveness of the new architecture. another salient feature of the proposed model is that it can be trained endtoend without any human intervention. it is very easy to be implemented. we conduct experiments on several sentimentlabeled datasets and analysis tasks. experiment results demonstrate that capturing comprehensive contextual information can significantly enhance the classification accuracy compared with the standard recurrent models and the new models can achieve competitive performance compared with the stateoftheart approaches.	3	1.0

efficient twitter sentiment classification using subjective distant supervision	as microblogging services like twitter are becoming more and more influential in today's globalized world, its facets like sentiment analysis are being extensively studied. we are no longer constrained by our own opinion. others' opinions and sentiments play a huge role in shaping our perspective. in this paper, we build on previous works on twitter sentiment analysis using distant supervision. the existing approach requires huge computation resource for analyzing large number of tweets. in this paper, we propose techniques to speed up the computation process for sentiment analysis. we use tweet subjectivity to select the right training samples. we also introduce the concept of efws (effective word score) of a tweet that is derived from polarity scores of frequently used words, which is an additional heuristic that can be used to speed up the sentiment classification with standard machine learning algorithms. we performed our experiments using 1.6 million tweets. experimental evaluations show that our proposed technique is more efficient and has higher accuracy compared to previously proposed methods. we achieve overall accuracies of around 80% (efws heuristic gives an accuracy around 85%) on a training dataset of 100k tweets, which is half the size of the dataset used for the baseline model. the accuracy of our proposed model is 23% higher than the baseline model, and the model effectively trains at twice the speed of the baseline model.	4	2.0
linguistically regularized lstms for sentiment classification	sentiment understanding has been a longterm goal of ai in the past decades. this paper deals with sentencelevel sentiment classification. though a variety of neural network models have been proposed very recently, however, previous models either depend on expensive phraselevel annotation, whose performance drops substantially when trained with only sentencelevel annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words), thus not being able to produce linguistically coherent representations. in this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentencelevel annotation, but also attempt to generating linguistically coherent representations by employing regularizers that model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. results show that our models are effective to capture the sentiment shifting effect of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, while still obtain competitive results without sacrificing the models' simplicity.	4	2.0

sentiment classification based on domain prediction	sentiment classification has received increasing attention in recent years. supervised learning methods for sentiment classification require considerable amount of labeled data for training purposes. as the number of domains increases, the task of collecting data becomes impractical. therefore, domain adaptation techniques are employed. however, most of the studies dealing with the domain adaptation problem demand a few amount of labeled data or lots of unlabeled data belonging to the target domain, which may not be always possible. in this work, a novel method for sentiment classification, which does not require labeled and/or unlabeled data from the target domain, is proposed. the propose method mainly consists of two stages. at first, the target domain is predicted even if it is not among the source domains in hand. then, sentiment is classified as either positive or negative using the sentiment classifier specifically trained for the predicted domain. extensive experimental analysis on two different datasets with distinct languages and domains verifies that the proposed method is superior to the domain independent sentiment classification approach at each case considered.  doi  http//dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eie.22.2.14599	3	0.5

fine grained sentiment classification of customer reviews using computational intelligent technique	online reviews are now popularly used for judging quality of product or service and influence decision making of users while selecting a product or service. due to innumerous number of customer reviews on the web, it is difficult to summarize them which require a faster opinion mining system to classify the reviews. many researchers have explored various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for binary classification of reviews. compared to these techniques, fuzzy logic can provide a straightforward and comparatively faster way to model the fuzziness existing between the sentiment polarities classes due to the ambiguity present in most of the natural languages. but the fuzzy logic techniques are less explored in this domain. hence in this paper, a fuzzy logic model based on the most popularly known sentiment based lexicon sentiwordnet has been proposed for fine grained classification of the reviews into weak positive, moderate positive, strong positive, weak negative, moderate negative and strong negative classes. experiments have been conducted on datasets containing reviews of electronic products namely smart phones, led tv and laptops and have shown to provide fine grained classification accuracy approximately in the range of 74% to 77%.	2	0.3333333333333333

sentiment classification of roman-urdu opinions using navie baysian, decision tree and knn classification techniques	sentiment mining is a field of text mining to determine the attitude of people about a particular product, topic, politician in newsgroup posts, review sites, comments on facebook posts and twitter etc. there are many issues involved in opinion mining. one important issue is that opinions could be in different languages (english, urdu, arabic etc.). to tackle each language according to its orientation is a challenging task. most of the research work in sentiment mining has been done in english language. currently, limited research is being carried out on sentiment classification of other languages like arabic, italian, urdu and hindi. in this paper, three classification models are used for text classification using waikato environment for knowledge analysis (weka). opinions written in romanurdu and english are extracted from a blog. these extracted opinions are documented in text files to prepare a training dataset containing 150 positive and 150 negative opinions, as labeled examples. testing data set is supplied to three different models and the results in each case are analyzed. the results show that na茂ve baysian outperformed decision tree and knn in term of more accuracy, precision, recall and fmeasure.	2	0.3333333333333333
a feature selection model based on genetic rank aggregation for text sentiment classification	sentiment analysis is an important research direction of natural language processing, text mining and web mining which aims to extract subjective information in source materials. the main challenge encountered in machine learning methodbased sentiment classification is the abundant amount of data available. this amount makes it difficult to train the learning algorithms in a feasible time and degrades the classification accuracy of the built model. hence, feature selection becomes an essential task in developing robust and efficient classification models whilst reducing the training time. in text mining applications, individual filterbased feature selection methods have been widely utilized owing to their simplicity and relatively high performance. this paper presents an ensemble approach for feature selection, which aggregates the several individual feature lists obtained by the different feature selection methods so that a more robust and efficient feature subset can be obtained. in order to aggregate the individual feature lists, a genetic algorithm has been utilized. experimental evaluations indicated that the proposed aggregation model is an efficient method and it outperforms individual filterbased feature selection methods on sentiment classification.	2	0.3333333333333333
content-specific unigrams and syntactic phrases to enhance sentiwordnet based sentiment classification	sentiment classification intelligently detects the polarity of documents by ascertaining polar values encapsulated in the document to classify them into positive and negative sentiments. machine learning classifier completely relies on the feature set orientations. sentiwordnet is a lexical resource where each term is associated with numerical scores for subjective and objective sentiment information. sentiwordnet based sentiment classifier uses sentiment features generated from 7% subjective terms available in the resource. sentiment features bear generic orientation for multiple domains but lacks comprehensive coverage e.g. text unit with null or few sentiment features reflects ambiguous or null sentiments. use of content specific unigrams and syntactic phrases along with sentiment features ensures consistency in the classification while enhancing the performance paradigm. model proposed in this research is validated on sentiment and polarity datasets. results of this research, completely out performs previous approaches and methods.	2	0.3333333333333333
using feature selection in combination with ensemble learning techniques to improve tweet sentiment classification performance	performing sentiment analysis of tweets by training a classifier is a challenging and complex task, requiring that the classifier can correctly and reliably identify the emotional polarity of a tweet. poor data quality, due to class imbalance or mislabeled instances, may negatively impact classification performance. ensemble learning techniques combine multiple models in an attempt to improve classification performance, especially on poor quality or imbalanced data, however, these techniques do not address the concern of high dimensionality present in tweets sentiment data and may require a prohibitive amount of resources to train on high dimensional data. this work addresses these issues by studying bagging and boosting combined with feature selection. these two techniques are denoted as selectbagging and selectboost, and seek to address both poor data quality and high dimensionality. we compare the performance of selectbagging and selectboost against feature selection alone. these techniques are tested with four base learners, two datasets and ten feature subset sizes. our results show that selectboost offers the highest performance, is significantly better than using no ensemble technique, and is significantly better than selectbagging for most learners on both datasets. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the effects of using ensemble learning in combination with feature selection for the purpose of tweet sentiment classification.	2	0.3333333333333333
improving sentiment classification accuracy of financial news using n-gram approach and feature weighting methods	sentiment classification of financial news deals with the identification of positive and negative news so that they can be applied in decision support system to perform stock trend predictions. this paper explores several types of feature space as different datasets for sentiment classification of the news article. experiments are conducted based on ngram approach (unigram, bigram and the combination of unigram and bigram) used as feature extraction with different feature weighting methods, while, document frequency (df) is used as feature selection method. we performed experiments to measure the classification accuracy of support vector machine (svm) with two kernel methods of linear and radial basis function (rbf). results showed that an efficient feature extraction increased classification accuracy when it is used as a combination of unigram and bigram. moreover, we also found that df can be applied as a dimension reduction method to reduce the feature space without loss of accuracy.	2	0.3333333333333333

a comparative study of feature selection and machine learning methods for sentiment classification on movie data set	sentiment analysis has become a leading research domain with the advent of web 2.0 where web users express their opinions in user forums, blogs, discussion boards, and review sites. the online information is considered to be a valuable source for decision making, improving the quality of service, and helping the service providers to enhance their competitiveness. since the processing of highdimensional text data is not scalable, different feature selection mechanisms are being used to confine the study to only most informative features. these features are then used to train the classifier to improve the accuracy of sentimentbased classification. this paper explores six feature selection mechanisms (ig, gr, chi, oner, relieff, and sae) with five different machine learning classifiers (svm, nb, dt, knn, and me) thereby providing accuracy, on the movie review data set for each. comparative results show that naive bayes (nb) outperforms other classifiers and works better for gain ratio (gr) and significance attribute evaluation (sae) feature selection method.	2	0.3333333333333333
review-level sentiment classification with sentence-level polarity correction	we propose an effective technique to solving reviewlevel sentiment classification problem by using sentencelevel polarity correction. our polarity correction technique takes into account the consistency of the polarities (positive and negative) of sentences within each product review before performing the actual machine learning task. while sentences with inconsistent polarities are removed, sentences with consistent polarities are used to learn stateoftheart classifiers. the technique achieved better results on different types of products reviews and outperforms baseline models without the correction technique. experimental results show an average of 82% fmeasure on four different product review domains.	2	0.3333333333333333

no sentiment is an island: sentiment classification on medical forums	in this study we propose a new method to classify sentiments in messages posted on online forums. traditionally, sentiment classification relies on analysis of emotionallycharged words and discourse units found in the classified text. in coherent online discussions, however, messages’ nonlexical metainformation can be sufficient to achieve reliable classification results. our empirical evidence is obtained through multiclass classification of messages posted on a medical forum.	2	0.3333333333333333
sentiment classification with graph sparsity regularization	text representation is a preprocessing step in building a classifier for sentiment analysis. but in vector space model (vsm) or bagof features (bof) model, features are independent of each other when to learn a classifier model. in this paper, we firstly explore the text graph structure which can represent the structural features in natural language text. different to the bof model, by directly embedding the features into a graph, we propose a graph sparsity regularization method which can make use of the the graph embedded features. our proposed method can encourage a sparse model with a small number of features connected by a set of paths. the experiments on sentiment classification demonstrate our proposed method can get better results comparing with other methods. qualitative discussion also shows that our proposed method with graphbased representation is interpretable and effective in sentiment classification task.	2	0.3333333333333333
personality based public sentiment classification in microblog	in recent years, microblog has become one of the most widely used social media for people to exchange ideas and express emotions. as information propagates fast in social network, it's crucial for governments and public agencies to effectively monitor public sentiment implied in usergenerated content. most previous work of public sentiment analysis takes tweets of different users as a whole without considering the diverse word use of people. thus, some sentiment words may be neglected in the process of analysis because they are only used by people of specific groups. inspired by previous psychological findings that personality influences the ways people write and talk, we propose a personality based sentiment classification method. in order to capture more useful but not widely used sentiment words, our approach extracts textual features for people of different personality traits based on the big five model. moreover, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy to utilize both personality related and commonly used textual features. experimental study shows the effectiveness of our method.	2	0.3333333333333333
